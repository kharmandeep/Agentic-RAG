Not available for the purchase or lease of a demo or used Lucid\nvehicle.\n\n***Terms and Conditions apply to your participation in the Referral Program.\nSee the _Referral Program_ page for details.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### Why is Lucid changing the maximum referral limit?\n\nWe are reducing the number to help return the program to its intended purpose\nof referring a friend.\n\n### What if the customer already has more than four referrals by the effective\ndate?\n\nThe customer will keep any accrued referral points but cannot add any\nadditional referrals until the new calendar year.\n\n### Do referral points expire?\n\nPoints awarded before January 1st, 2025 have an expiration period of 5 years.\nPoints awarded after January 1st, 2025 will have an expiration period of 2\nyears.\n\n### Do pending orders count towards the referral limit?\n\nYes, a referral counts once your referral code has been used to place an\norder. If the order is canceled before delivery, the referral is removed.\n\n### When will the referral limit reset?\n\nOn the first day of each calendar year (January 1st), the referral limits will\nreset for all owners.\n\n### Do special referral incentive periods count towards the limit?\n\nUnless indicated otherwise, referrals earned during an incentive period count\ntowards the limit.\n\n###  Can a referral be added after an order has been placed?\n\nNo, referrals cannot be retroactively added to existing orders.\n\n### Can I change or update the referral code after placing an order?\n\nNo, referral codes cannot be modified after placing an order.\n\n### How can I track my referrals?\n\nYou can manage referrals and keep track of their status in the owner's portal\nunder the ‘Referral Program’ tab.\n\n### Are referral points transferable?\n\nNo, referral points are non-transferable.\n\n### When will I receive my referral points?\n\nPoints are generally awarded within 60 days of delivery of the referred\ncustomer’s vehicle.

(“we,”“us,” “Lucid”) offers you the opportunity to earn\nrewards points by referring friends to purchase a Lucid vehicle (a “Vehicle\nPurchase”). Your participation in the Lucid Referral Program (“Lucid Referral\nProgram” or “Program”) can earn you points as described below. We reserve the\nright to terminate the Program at any time for any reason.\n\nThese terms (“Terms”) apply to your participation in the Program. By\nparticipating in the Program, you agree to use the Program as outlined herein,\nand consistent with any other terms we may apply to the Program. If you do not\nagree to these Terms in their entirety, then you cannot participate in the\nProgram. You also cannot participate in the Program where in so doing, you\nwould violate any applicable law or regulations.\n\nEligibility\n\nThis Program is void in states and territories where referral benefits are\nprohibited by law, including Ohio and Virginia. Residents of such states or\nterritories are not eligible to participate in the Program. Existing customers\nwho refer others to the program using their unique referral link are\n“Referrers”; those who are referred and use the referral link to complete a\npurchase or lease of a Lucid vehicle are “Referred Customers.” Referrers may\nbe eligible to receive “Points” or a specified reward for every qualified\nreferral as described below. Referrers and Referred Customers must be legally\nable to participate in the Program, must reside in the United States, and must\nbe an individual who is at least eighteen years of age. When registering for\nthe Program, Referrers must use the same email address that is registered with\ntheir existing Lucid account. Referrers must be current Lucid owners who are\nreferring customers without an existing order to become first-time Lucid\nowners. Referrers who engage in spamming or other unfair or otherwise\nproblematic practices, including creating fake accounts or harassing potential\nreferral sources will be deemed ineligible to participate in the Program.\n\nHow It Works\n\nTo participate, you simply share the unique referral code generated for you\nand available in your Owner’s Portal. You may share your link or QR code with\nfriends and family. Lucid owners may only redeem points for up to 4 Referred\nCustomers per calendar year. The limit will be reached when there are 4\nconfirmed orders using one referral link. Only one Referrer can be associated\nwith a Referred Customer and Lucid will credit the first Referrer. If you are\nthe first Referrer associated with that customer and that customer is a first-\ntime customer who does not have an existing order, you will be considered a\nReferrer for that Referred Customer. If your referred customer places an order\nfor and takes delivery of a Lucid vehicle, you will receive either reward\npoints (“Points”) or a specific reward, depending on the vehicle your Referred\nCustomer purchases. The number of Points or reward you receive for each\nReferred Customer depends upon the Lucid vehicle they purchase using your\nreferral link, as shown in the table below. Referrers may redeem their Points\nfor items and/or experiences that match their value as indicated in the Lucid\nRewards Store. Points values listed for items and experiences in the Lucid\nRewards Store are exclusive of sales tax.\n\nPoints are only for designated Lucid products and experiences available in the\nLucid Rewards Store and may never be redeemed for cash or products and\nservices in the Lucid Store (store.lucidmotors.com). Points are non-\ntransferrable, non-assignable, and cannot be bequeathed to anyone else in the\nevent of death. Any product or experience redeemed by a Referrer is a final\ntransaction, and such product or experience cannot be returned for a refund or\nexchanged. Referrer is responsible for all taxes associated with points\naccrual and redemption. Referrer is responsible for all taxes associated with\npoints accrual and redemption. A W-9 will need to be completed by the\nReferrer. To the extent permitted by applicable law, if the Referrer does not\ncomplete a Form W-9 within 60 days of such request, Lucid reserves the right\nto rescind referrer’s points.\n\nPoints will generally be awarded within 60 days of delivery of the Referred\nCustomer’s vehicle. Lucid may withhold or invalidate any Points garnered in\nways that it deems fraudulent, suspect, or in violation of these Terms. A\nReferrer’s points will expire two (2) years after they are issued or earlier\nif this program is terminated. All of Lucid’s decisions are final and binding,\nexcept where prohibited, including when and if to terminate the Program, and\nwhether, if at all, to change the Program. Any changes to the Program will be\ncommunicated to Referrers in any manner Lucid so chooses to Referrers and,\nexcept where prohibited, will become effective as of the date the\ncommunication is sent or published. If a Referrer has referrals pending at the\ntime that updates are sent, those pending referrals shall be evaluated under\nthe terms that were valid at the time the Referred Customer placed their\norder.\n\nReferred Customers will also be eligible for cash discounts on their referred\npurchase, as indicated in the table below.\n\nVehicle purchased or leased by referred customer\n\nReferrer points earned\n\nDiscount available to referred customer\n\nLucid Air Pure\n\n4,000 points\n\n$500 discount on Vehicle Purchase or Lease\n\nLucid Air Touring\n\n4,000 points\n\n$1,000 discount on Vehicle Purchase or Lease\n\nLucid Air Grand Touring\n\n4,000 points\n\n$1,250 discount on Vehicle Purchase or Lease\n\nLucid Air Sapphire\n\nNot eligible\n\nNot eligible\n\nLucid Gravity Grand Touring\n\nNot eligible\n\nNot eligible\n\n*Points and discounts only available for the purchase or lease of a new Lucid vehicle. Not available for the purchase or lease of a demo or used Lucid vehicle. \n\nCustomers using their own referral link to purchase another Lucid vehicle will\nbe eligible for the applicable cash discount, but they will not receive\nReferrer Points on their own purchase.\n\nLiability Release\n\nExcept where prohibited, Referrers agree that by participating in the Program,\nthey agree: (1) to be bound by these Terms, the decisions of Lucid, and\nprivacy policies; (2) to release and hold harmless Lucid and its respective\nparent companies, affiliates and subsidiaries, together with their respective\nemployees, directors, officers, licensees, licensors, shareholders, attorneys\nand agents including, without limitation, their respective advertising and\npromotion entities and any person or entity associated with the production,\noperation or administration of the Program (collectively, the “Released\nParties”), from any and all claims, demands, damages, losses, liabilities,\ncosts or expenses caused by, arising out of, in connection with, or related to\ntheir participation in the Program (including, without limitation, any\nproperty loss, damage, personal injury or death caused to any person(s) and/or\nthe awarding, receipt and/or use or misuse of the Program or Points); and (3)\nto be contacted by Lucid via email.\n\nAs a condition of entering the Program, and unless prohibited by law,\nReferrers agree that under no circumstances will Referrers be entitled to any\nawards for any losses or damages, and Referrers hereby waive all rights to\nclaim punitive, incidental, consequential and any other damages, and waives\nany and all rights to have damages multiplied or otherwise increased.

The 2025 Lucid Air Grand Touring produces about 6% fewer greenhouse gas\nemissions during use than the leading U.S. EV competitor, and about 30% less\nemissions than the leading German EV competitor.¹\n\n## Greater Efficiency for the Greater Good\n\nFor Lucid, efficiency means using less materials and energy to do more, while\nbeing intentional about our use of the planet’s resources. Our commitment to\nefficiency has created one of the fastest-charging, longest range, and most\nefficient EVs. By using fewer batteries and less grid electricity, we’ve\nreduced the demand for critical materials and their environmental impact.\n\n## EV change is here\n\nWe are committed to inspiring the adoption of sustainable energy through our\nadvanced technologies. Our technological innovations are revolutionizing\nelectric mobility and building the foundations for a zero-emissions future.\n\n## Our people make a world of difference\n\nWe believe supporting our employees and communities is key to a more\nsustainable future. At Lucid, we’re fostering a culture and mindset of\nsustainability that amplifies our impact well beyond the walls of our\norganization.\n\n## United Nations Global Compact\n\nLucid is a proud participant of the United Nations Global Compact (UN Global\nCompact), the world’s largest voluntary corporate sustainability initiative.\nThe UN Global Compact challenges companies to conduct business responsibly by\naligning their operations and strategies with the UN’s Ten Principles which\npertain to human rights, labor, environmental practices, and anti-corruption.\nIt also commits companies to take actions in accordance with the UN\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Even if you turn off Data Sharing, your\nvehicle will also still share certain limited Vehicle Health and Status Data\nwith Lucid as necessary to send over-the-air software and firmware updates to\nyour vehicle.\n\nPlease also note that turning off Data Sharing will necessarily disable some\nconnected features in your vehicle that require communication with Lucid’s\nservices, including signing in and out of your user profile, saving and\nrestoring user profiles and preferences, resetting user PINs, and Lucid mobile\napp interactions. Turning off Data Sharing may also impact our ability to\nperform remote diagnostic services for your vehicle. If you want to turn Data\nSharing back on, you can do so at any time to re-enable these features and\nresume transmitting Vehicle Data to Lucid.\n\nSPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS\n\nLucid processes Personal Information on the legal basis of its legitimate\ninterest of providing services to its vehicle operators and managing its own\nbusiness, compliance with laws and regulations to which Lucid is subject, as\nwell as necessity to perform contractual obligations related to the Lucid\nvehicle owned or operated by you. At times Lucid may process Personal\nInformation on the legal basis of consent. You will be provided an opportunity\nto consent to such processing prior to the time such processing starts; for\nexample, if we are using specific geolocation data to provide you marketing\nservices via the Lucid vehicle infotainment system.\n\nPursuant to certain state or foreign laws (for example, California Civil Code\nSection 1798.100 et. seq, the EU General Data Protection Regulation, etc.) if\nyou live in a jurisdiction with a relevant privacy law, you may request\ncertain information about the type of your Personal Information we share with\nthird parties for direct marketing purposes and the identity of any such third\nparty. At least once per calendar year, residents of certain states or\ncountries may request this information by contacting us as set forth below.\n\nAdditionally, these jurisdictions may provide their residents certain rights\nas they relate to Personal Information, possibly including the following:\n\nRight to Know. You may request that Lucid provide you the specific pieces of\nPersonal Information Lucid has about you; categories of Personal Information\nwe have collected about you; categories of sources from which the Personal\nInformation is collected; categories of Personal Information that Lucid sold\nor disclosed for a business purpose about you; categories of third parties to\nwhom the Personal Information was sold or disclosed for a business purpose;\nand the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling Personal\nInformation. Please note that much of the information you can make a request\nfor is already contained in this Notice.

If you do not\nhave an account with Lucid, we may ask for some Personal Information in order\nto verify your identity and your rights to the data subject to your request.\n\nRight to Delete. Some jurisdiction's law gives their residents a limited right\nto request deletion of their Personal Information. However, this right is\nlimited by a number of exceptions. Fundamentally, if Lucid has a permissible\nneed to retain Personal Information, we are not under an obligation to delete\nsuch information, even when requested. Generally, we retain Personal\nInformation so we may complete the transaction for which the Personal\nInformation was collected, provide a good or service requested by you, or\nreasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship\nwith you, or otherwise perform a contract between us and you; detect security\nincidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal\nactivity; or prosecute those responsible for that activity; debug to identify\nand repair errors that impair existing intended functionality of our online\nproperties; enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with your\nexpectations based on your relationship with Lucid; comply with a legal\nobligation; or otherwise use your Personal Information, internally, in a\nlawful manner that is compatible with the context in which your provided the\ninformation. As such, we generally do not accept requests to delete Vehicle\nData. However, we will respond to requests to remove Personal Information from\nsome of our systems as a part of a request to close or otherwise disable a\nmembership account. If you would like to request deletion of Personal\nInformation, please see the section below which explains how to do so. If you\ndo not have an account with Lucid, we may ask for some Personal Information in\norder to verify your identity and your rights to the data subject to your\nrequest.\n\nRight to Correct. You may request that Lucid correct specific pieces of\nincorrect Personal Information Lucid has about you, provided it is technically\nfeasible and demonstrable. Please note that Personal Information that is\nobjectively correct is not subject to this right. Additionally, any opinion\ndata about you is also not subject to this right. Should you wish to exercise\nthis right, please see the section below which explains how to do so. If you\ndo not have an account with Lucid, we may ask for some Personal Information in\norder to verify your identity and your rights to the data which is subject to\nyour request.\n\nRight to Object to Processing or Restrict Processing. You may object to\nLucid's processing of data or request restriction of processing of your\nPersonal Information. When you make this request, which is evaluated on a\ncase-by-case basis, we may ask for additional information to assess the\nrequest and determine whether we have a reasonable basis to reject the request\npursuant to local laws, such as the establishment, exercise, or defense of\nlegal claims.\n\nDesignating an Authorized Agent. California law permits California residents\nto designate an agent to manage their rights under California law. If you\nwould like to designate an agent to manage your privacy preferences, you may\ndo so using the mechanisms noted below under “Exercising Privacy Rights”. Note\nthat if you do not have an account with Lucid, we may ask for some Personal\nInformation in order to verify your identity and your rights to the data\nsubject to your request. We will also need sufficient Personal Information\nabout your authorized agent to be able to identify them. As part of this\nprocess, you must have permission from your authorized agent to disclose their\nPersonal Information to us for the purpose of acting as your agent.\n\nNon-discrimination. Lucid will not discriminate against you because you\nexercised any your rights under this title, including, but not limited to:\ndenying you access to goods or services; charging different prices or rates\nfor goods or services, including through the use of discounts or other\nbenefits or imposing penalties; providing a different level or quality of\ngoods or services; suggesting that you will receive a different price or rate\nfor goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.\n\nExercising Your Privacy Rights.

We will use the information\nyou provide to verify your identity. Agents acting on behalf of others may use\nthe same channels and may be required to provide proof of their authorization.\n\nShould we decline any of your requests, the law in some locations may permit\nyou to appeal our decision.

(“us” or “we” or “Lucid”). We want to improve\nroad safety through the use and further development of driver assistance\nsystems. Our aim is to reduce the number of road accidents, in particular road\nfatalities, by incorporating and improving driver assistance systems.\n\nFor this purpose, we are currently operating a fleet of Lucid vehicles on the\nroad in the European Union for testing purposes, identified by a logo (see\nbelow), and which record data from various sensors, including video and audio\nrecordings of the vehicle environment. This privacy statement describes the\nnature and use of personal data that may be recorded of the surroundings of\nthe car by driver assistance systems for these testing purposes.\n\nThis privacy statement does not apply to vehicle data collected during the\noperation of a vehicle outside of the testing environment. For information\nregarding the collection of vehicle data such as Vehicle Health, User Vehicle\nInteractions or Status Data, please visit our Lucid Motors Vehicle Data\nPrivacy Policy for additional information.\n\nThis privacy statement also does not apply to the collection of data when you\nuse a Lucid website or app, or in relation to your ordering, financing or\ntaking delivery of a Lucid vehicle. For further information regarding the\ncollection of such data, visit one of our stores or service centers, or\ncontact us directly by email or by phone. Please visit our Privacy Policy for\nadditional information.\n\nHow do I recognize the Lucid test vehicles?\n\nThe Lucid test vehicles are identified by this logo.\n\nWho is the data controller responsible for the data processing?\n\nWe are the controller within the meaning of the EU General Data Protection\nRegulation (“GDPR”) for the processing of personal data related to video and\naudio recordings collected by the Lucid test vehicles.\n\nWhat data do we process from you and for what purpose?\n\nThe personal data collected through the use of Lucid test vehicles on public\nroads are processed as follows:\n\nLucid vehicles are equipped with various sensors (such as radar, ultrasonic,\nGPS/location sensors), interior microphones and video cameras. Public road\ntraffic (environment of the Lucid vehicle) is recorded on data, video and\naudio files, and stored and processed for further analysis, and combined with\nother sensor data if necessary.\n\nThe video recordings are used to create static and dynamic traffic objects _._\nThese can be road markings, cars, motorbikes, bicycles, etc. with their\nindividual position and movement in relation to the Lucid vehicle as well as\nthe position and movement of pedestrians. To calculate the possible movement\nof a pedestrian - e.g. whether a person intends to cross a road - their line\nof sight can also be analysed.\n\nThe video and sensor data are used while driving to recognize road users and\nbasic traffic scenarios and act accordingly. In a further evaluation of the\nrecordings, the video and sensor data are used to develop and improve the\ndriver assistance systems.\n\nWe are not interested in identifying a person and our systems are not\nconfigured for such purposes, as this is not necessary for the use and further\ndevelopment of the driver assistance systems. All traffic objects are only\ncategorised as cars, motorbikes, pedestrians, etc. Nevertheless, the video\nrecordings may include recordings of individuals in traffic, car registration\nnumbers or other personal data.\n\nWhat is the legal basis for this data processing?\n\nThe legal basis for collecting and processing the video recordings of the\nsurroundings of the Lucid vehicle (including the recordings of personal data\nof pedestrians and drivers) is based on the legitimate interests pursued by\nthe controller according to Sec. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR.\n\nLucid has a legitimate interest in the further development of driver\nassistance systems. The data collected by the Lucid vehicles will be used to\nimprove and develop algorithms for various functions of the driver assistance\nsystems.__ This can also serve the public interest. Video recording of the\nsurroundings of Lucid vehicles is necessary to improve the road safety of\nthese vehicles.\n\nThe processing and storage of the collected data is furthermore particularly\nimportant for protection in the event of legal proceedings or to comply with\nlegal obligations, in particular the requirements of the supervisory\nauthorities.\n\nHow long do we store your data?\n\nWe exclusively store your personal data for as long as the respective purpose\nof processing requires. If data is processed for more than one purpose, the\ndata will be deleted or will only continue to be stored in a form that cannot\nbe directly traced back to you as soon as the last stated purpose of\nprocessing has been fulfilled.\n\nHow is your data secured?\n\nWe secure your data according to the state of the art. Access to personal data\nis restricted to a limited number of authorised persons for the stated\npurposes. The following security measures are used as examples to protect your\npersonal data from misuse or other unauthorised processing:\n\n  * Collected data is only transmitted in encrypted form.\n\n  * The IT systems used to process the data are technically isolated from other systems to prevent unauthorised access, e.g. through hacking.\n\n  * In addition, access to these IT systems is permanently monitored in order to detect and prevent misuse at an early stage.\n\nWho do we share data with and how do we protect you in the process?\n\nWe share the data with other affiliated companies, in particular with Lucid\nGroup, Inc.\n\nWhen data is processed in countries outside the European Union (EU), Lucid\nuses EU standard contractual clauses to ensure that your personal data is\nprocessed in accordance with European data protection standards. If you would\nlike to view the specific safeguards for transferring data to other countries,\nplease contact us through one of the communication channels listed below.\n\nB. Contact details, your data subject rights and your right to complain to a\nsupervisory authority\n\nIf you have any questions regarding the use of your personal data, we\nrecommend that you contact Lucid Privacy by sending a message to the following\ne-mail address: Privacy@Lucidmotors.com\n\nYou can also contact the responsible data protection officer:\n\nJoke Bodewits joke.bodewits@​hoganlovells.com Atrium - North Tower\nStrawinskylaan 4129 Amsterdam 1077 ZX The Netherlands\n\nC. Data subject rights\n\nAs a data subject affected by the processing of your data, you can assert\ncertain rights with us under the GDPR as well as under other relevant data\nprotection provisions.\n\nIn certain situations, we may not be able to provide you with information on\nall collected data due to legal requirements or the information available to\nus. In such cases, we cannot retrieve the recorded person’s data without\nadditional information. If the recorded persons cannot be identified without\nadditional information and because such recognition is not necessary for the\nprocessing purpose pursued at Lucid, we are not allowed by law to carry out\nany additional data processing for identification purposes; in such cases,\nyour rights under Sec.15 to 20 GDPR might be excluded. Your data subject\nrights are only applicable if you provide us with additional information that\nallows us to uniquely identify you. Even with this additional information, we\nmight not be able to verify your right to access or erase the data because we\ndo not identify individuals on the video and audio recordings and therefore do\nnot know who the data subjects on the recordings are. Your data subject rights\nare limited by the rights of others or by the need to retain the data for\nother legal reasons.\n\nAccording to the GDPR, you as a data subject are in particular entitled to the\nfollowing rights against Lucid:\n\nRight of Access (Sec. 15 GDPR):\n\nYou can request information from us at any time about the data we hold about\nyou. This information concerns, among other things, the categories of data we\nprocess, the purposes for which we process them, the origin of the data if we\nhave not collected it directly from you and, if applicable, the recipients to\nwhom we have transmitted your data. You can obtain a copy of your data from us\nfree of charge. Should you be interested in further copies, we reserve the\nright to charge you for the further copies.\n\nRight to rectification (Sec. 16 GDPR):\n\nYou can ask us to rectify your data. We will take reasonable steps to keep the\ndata we hold about you and process on an ongoing basis accurate, complete and\nup to date based on the most recent information available to us.\n\nRight to erasure (Sec. 17 GDPR):\n\nYou can demand that we delete your data if the legal requirements for this are\nmet. According to Sec. 17 GDPR, this may be the case if:\n\n  * the data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed;\n\n  * you withdraw your consent, which is the basis for the data processing, and there is no other legal basis for the processing;\n\n  * you object to the processing of your data and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or you object to the processing of data for direct marketing purposes;\n\n  * the data has been processed unlawfully unless the processing is necessary to ensure compliance with a legal obligation requiring us to process your data;\n\n  * in particular with regard to legal retention periods;\n\n  * to assert, exercise or defend legal claims.\n\nRight to restriction of processing (Sec. 18 GDPR):\n\nYou can ask us to restrict the processing of your data if:\n\n  * you dispute the accuracy of the data for the period of time we need to verify the accuracy of the data;\n\n  * the processing is unlawful and you object to the erasure of your data and request the restriction of its use instead;\n\n  * we no longer need your data but you need it to assert, exercise or defend legal claims;\n\n  * you have objected to the processing as long as it has not yet been determined whether our legitimate grounds outweigh yours.\n\nRight to data portability (Sec. 20 GDPR):\n\nAt your request, we will transfer your data - insofar as this is technically\npossible - to another controller. However, you only have this right if the\ndata processing is based on your consent or is necessary to perform a\ncontract. Instead of receiving a copy of your data, you can also ask us to\ntransfer the data directly to another controller specified by you.\n\nRight to object (Sec. 21 GDPR):\n\nYou may object to the processing of your data at any time for reasons arising\nfrom your particular situation, provided that the data processing is based on\nyour consent or on our legitimate interests or those of a third party. In this\ncase, we will no longer process your data. The latter does not apply if we can\ndemonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override\nyour interests or we need your data to assert, exercise or defend legal\nclaims.\n\nD. Deadlines for the fulfilment of data subject rights\n\nWe generally aim to comply with all requests within 30 days. However, this\nperiod may be extended for reasons relating to the specific data subject right\nor the complexity of your request.\n\nE. Complaint to supervisory authorities\n\nLucid takes your concerns and rights very seriously. However, if you feel that\nwe have not adequately addressed your complaints or concerns, you have the\nright to lodge a complaint with a competent data protection authority.\n\nThe competent data protection authority for us is the Dutch supervisory\nauthority Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens, PO Box 93374, 2509 AJ DEN HAAG.\n\n## Website and Mobile App\n\n### Terms of Use\n\nLast update: July 2024\n\nWelcome to our website.

In connection with anything\nyou submit to us, unless solicited in writing by us, you agree that product\nproposals, ideas, suggestions, materials, or business opportunities you submit\n(“Submissions”) are not being made in confidence or trust and that no\nconfidential or fiduciary relationship is intended or created between you and\nus in any way, and that you have no expectation of review, compensation, or\nconsideration of any type. By providing us with a Submission, you hereby: (i)\ngrant to Lucid a world-wide, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable, sub-\nlicensable, royalty-free, non-exclusive, and unrestricted license to copy,\nreproduce, adapt, transmit, edit, modify, or otherwise use, publicly display,\ndistribute, translate and create compilations and derivative works from, any\nand all Submissions (in any format or media) that you post on, upload or\notherwise submit to or through, the website; and (ii) waive all moral rights\nin and to all Submissions that you post on, upload or otherwise submit to or\nthrough, the website in favor of Lucid. For greater certainty, this means\nthat, among other things, Lucid has the right to use any and all ideas you\nsubmit (including ideas about our products, services, publications or\nadvertising campaigns) in any manner that we choose, without any notice or\nobligation to you whatsoever.\n\nBy providing a Submission, you hereby acknowledge, agree, warrant and\nrepresent to Lucid that any and all Submissions (in any format or media) you\npost on, upload to or otherwise submit to or through, the website:\n\n     1. is original to you and that you have obtained all necessary rights in and to the Submission and all of its components (if applicable) to post, upload, or otherwise submit it to or through the website; and\n\n     2. does not violate any law or regulation; and\n\n     3. complies with these Terms of Use.\n\nGoverning Law and Jurisdiction\n\nFor users who are not individuals resident in the Province of Quebec, all\nmatters relating to our website and these terms and any dispute or claim\narising therefrom or related thereto (in each case, including non-contractual\ndisputes or claims) will be governed by and construed in accordance with the\nlaws of California, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law\nprovision.\n\nFor users who are an individual resident in the Province of Quebec, all\nmatters relating to our website and these terms and any dispute or claim\narising therefrom or related thereto (in each case, including non-contractual\ndisputes or claims) will be governed by and construed in accordance with the\nlaws of Quebec, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law\nprovision.\n\nDisputes, Arbitration, Waiver of Jury Demand\n\nThis section, referred to as the “Website Terms Arbitration Agreement,”\nmandates the resolution of disputes through binding arbitration, rather than\nin a court of law. However, either party may bring claims in small claims\ncourt if they meet the necessary criteria. Arbitration does not involve a\njudge or jury, and the court’s review of arbitration awards is limited.\nNevertheless, an arbitrator may award the same damages and relief as a court\non an individual basis, including injunctive, declaratory relief, or statutory\ndamages.\n\nThe term “Disputes” encompasses the following: (1) Any dispute or claim\nbetween you and Lucid Entities; (2) Any dispute or claim arising from or\nrelated to your use of the website, or any resulting transactions or\nrelationships (including with nonsignatory third parties). “Lucid Entities”\ninclude Lucid Group USA, Inc.; Lucid USA, Inc.; Lucid Motors Canada ULC; their\nparents, subsidiaries, predecessors, successors, assignees, officers,\nemployees, representatives, agents, affiliates, and authorized service and\nrepair facilities.\n\nDisputes concerning the validity, application, scope, enforceability, or\ninterpretation of this Website Terms Arbitration Agreement will be exclusively\ndecided by the arbitrator. The Website Terms Arbitration Agreement and\nassociated proceedings, such as waiver or estoppel before, during, or after\narbitration, will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C § 1 et\nseq., and federal common law, not by any state laws or procedures regarding\narbitration. The arbitrator holds the exclusive authority to address\nchallenges to this Website Terms Arbitration Agreement, including questions of\nwaiver, estoppel, breach, or the validity of any part of this Website Terms\nArbitration Agreement.\n\nBefore initiating any dispute or claim through arbitration or otherwise, you\nand we must engage in an informal telephonic dispute resolution conference\n(“Conference”). If you are a natural person, you must participate in the\nConference, while non-natural-person parties must designate a representative.\n\nTo initiate a Conference, one party must provide written notice to the other\nparty, including the initiating party’s name, contact information, a\ndescription of the dispute, the requested amount for resolution, and the\npersonal signature of any natural-person party (a copy may be submitted via\nemail). The notice can be sent to us at disputes@lucidmotors.com. The\nConference should occur within 60 days after the other party receives the\nnotice, and during this process, any statute of limitations or filing\ndeadlines will be suspended. An initiating party’s failure to participate in\nthis process will result in the arbitrator dismissing that party’s arbitration\ndemand.\n\nFor certain warranty disputes, you may opt to use the BBB AUTO LINE procedure\noutlined in your Vehicle’s limited warranty. All unresolved Disputes remain\nsubject to this Website Terms Arbitration Agreement.\n\nThe arbitration will be conducted by New Era ADR (www.neweraadr.com) or the\nAmerican Arbitration Association (“AAA”) (www.adr.org). Unless modified by\nthis Arbitration Agreement, New Era ADR’s arbitration will follow its Virtual\nExpedited Arbitration Rules and Procedures (www.neweraadr.com/rules-and-\nprocedures/), while AAA’s arbitration will adhere to AAA’s Consumer\nArbitration Rules (www.adr.org). A neutral arbitrator must be appointed, and\nboth parties will be responsible for their respective initial filing fees to\ninitiate arbitration. Subsequently, each party will cover their filing,\nadministration, service or case management fees, as well as the arbitrator or\nhearing fees, up to a maximum of $5,000, unless the law or the rules of the\nchosen arbitration organization require us to pay more.\n\nYou and we may only bring disputes against each other on an individual basis\nand not as part of a class, collective, consolidated, or representative\naction. However, both parties may file a court suit to: enjoin intellectual\nproperty rights infringement, file for bankruptcy, enforce a security interest\nin the Vehicle through repossession, enforce the arbitrator’s decision, or\nrequest a court review if the arbitrator exceeded their authority.\n\nDiscovery procedures as outlined in the New Era ADR or AAA rules should\nsuffice for most claims. If there is a dispute over the scope of discovery, it\nshould include the right for either side to inspect the Vehicle and exchange\nrelevant Vehicle-related documents.\n\nUnless the governing law requires a specific statute of limitations for a\nparticular arbitration claim, any claim related to a Dispute must be filed no\nlater than three (3) years after the claim or cause of action arose, or it\nwill be forever barred.\n\nIf any part of this Website Terms Arbitration Agreement is unenforceable, it\nwill be severed, and the remaining portions will be enforced. However, if the\nclass-action waiver is deemed unenforceable in a Dispute involving class\nallegations, the entire Website Terms Arbitration Agreement will be\nunenforceable for that Dispute.\n\nIn cases where multiple claims or remedies are asserted in one proceeding, and\nnot all of them are subject to arbitration, the non-arbitrable claims or\nremedies must be stayed until all arbitrable claims or remedies have been\nresolved. If one party files a court action, the other party may seek to\ncompel arbitration, and all proceedings will be stayed until the full\nresolution of the proceedings to compel arbitration, including any related\nappeals.\n\nOpt-Out: You have the option to opt-out of this Website Terms Arbitration\nAgreement within 30 days from the date of placing your Order. To do so, send\nan email to Optout@LucidMotors.com from the email associated with your order,\nwith “Website Terms Arbitration Opt-Out” in the subject line and a request to\nopt-out of this Website Terms Arbitration Agreement in the email’s body.\nOpting out only applies to this Website Terms Arbitration Agreement and will\nnot affect the validity or enforceability of any other arbitration agreements.\n\nTermination\n\nIf you breach any provision of these Terms of Use you may no longer use the\nwebsite.

As such, the security of our systems, applications, and\ndata is paramount. If you are a security researcher and have discovered a\nsecurity vulnerability in one of our services, we appreciate your help in\ndisclosing it to us in a responsible manner.\n\n### Vulnerability Disclosure Guidelines\n\nWe will investigate legitimate reports and make every effort to quickly\ncorrect any vulnerability. To encourage responsible reporting, we will not\ntake legal action nor ask law enforcement to investigate you, provided you\ncomply with the following Vulnerability Disclosure Guidelines:\n\n  * Engage in this program in good faith and in compliance with all applicable laws\n\n  * Provide details of the vulnerability, including the methodology and any other information needed to reproduce and validate the vulnerability. Where possible, provide a Proof of Concept (POC).\n\n  * Confirm you are not a on the Specially Designated Nationals List or a resident of a country sanctioned by the United States government\n\nYou further agree that by participating in this program, you will not:\n\n  * Publicly disclose any vulnerability identified and reported to Lucid Motors through this program before Lucid Motors completes remediation of the issue\n\n  * Compromise or disclose any confidential or proprietary information belonging to Lucid Motors or related entities\n\n  * Access or disclose any employee, customer, vehicle operator or other individual’s personal information that is not your own\n\n  * Conduct any vulnerability testing or activities that could harm or put at risk of harm Lucid Motors, its employees, its customers, or any other individuals, including denial-of-service, social engineering, phishing, etc.\n\n  * Conduct any vulnerability testing or activities that could compromise or impact any vehicle that you do not own\n\n  * Test the physical security of any Lucid Motors property or the property of any other individual that has not given you express consent\n\n### Ratings\n\n _For the initial prioritization/rating of findings, this program will use\nthe_ __Bugcrowd Vulnerability Rating Taxonomy__ _. However, it is important to\nnote that in some cases a vulnerability priority will be modified due to its\nlikelihood or impact. In any instance where an issue is downgraded, a full,\ndetailed explanation will be provided to the researcher - along with the\nopportunity to appeal and make a case for a higher priority._\n\n###  Scope\n\n _In-Scope_\n\nIn principle, any Lucid-owned web service that handles reasonably sensitive\nuser data is intended to be in scope. This includes virtually all the content\nin the following domain - lucidmotors.com. Anything not defined here is out-\nof-scope of this program.\n\n_Qualifying vulnerabilities_ Any design or implementation issue that\nsubstantially affects the confidentiality or integrity of user data or\nfunctionalities of Lucid-owned web service is likely to be in scope for the\nprogram.

A brand campaign directed by James Mangold,\nfeaturing Timothée Chalamet and Lucid Gravity.\n\nWatch Now\n\nLucid Air\n\nLucid Gravity\n\nPre-Owned\n\nDiscover\n\nDEMO DRIVE\n\nUS\n\nMenu\n\n# Company\n\nThrough technology we create exceptional experiences to drive the world\nforward.\n\n### At Lucid  \nWe are driving a revolution.  \nOne that compromises nothing  \nby obsessing over everything.  \n  \nPerformance that defies limits.  \nGoing farther with less.  \nSpace large enough for life.  \nDesign that’s impossible to ignore.  \nAll with a passion for preserving our planet.  \n  \nHere’s to advancing technology  \nthat drives the world forward.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nWe aim to create sustainable mobility without compromise in cars that are\nintuitive, liberating, and designed for all the ways people get around. At\nLucid, we place an exceptionally high priority on efficiency — our cars must\nmake the best possible use of the world’s resources. So, every Lucid delivers\nexceptional range without sacrificing high performance or sublime comfort.\n\nDiscover\n\n## Leadership\n\nLucid’s leadership team brings to our Silicon Valley headquarters an\nextraordinary depth of knowledge and experience from the automotive and\ntechnology industries. They’re leading us forward to a more sustainable future\nas we use proprietary electric vehicle technology to reinvent the category for\neach type of car we build.\n\nDiscover\n\n## Careers\n\nCome work alongside some of the most accomplished minds in the automotive and\ntechnology industries. Beyond competitive salaries, we are creating a\ncommunity for innovators who want to make a significant — and immediate —\ncontribution to the future of sustainable mobility.\n\nDiscover\n\n## Lucid Motors Factory\n\nAfter evaluating over 60 sites in 13 states for the Lucid Motors factory, we\nchose a 500-acre property in Casa Grande, Arizona. Located between Phoenix and\nTucson — and within easy reach of our Silicon Valley headquarters — the Casa\nGrande offered close proximity to critical utilities, an established\ntransportation system, and strong support from state and local governments.\n\nThis facility is the first greenfield — or purpose-built — EV factory in North\nAmerica. Designed to our exact specifications, it is being built with such\nefficiency and speed that we will complete construction of its first phase a\nmere 12 months after breaking ground.\n\n### Lucid Air\n\nExplore Lucid Air\n\nCompare Vehicles\n\nPure\n\nTouring\n\nGrand Touring\n\nSapphire\n\nFleet\n\nDesign Yours\n\nAvailable Vehicles\n\nDemo Drive\n\n### Lucid Gravity\n\nExplore Lucid Gravity\n\nCompare Vehicles\n\nRoad to Lucid Gravity Videos\n\nDesign Yours\n\nAvailable Vehicles\n\nLucid Gravity Essentials\n\nStay Informed\n\nDemo Drive\n\n### Lucid Motors\n\nCompany\n\nLeadership\n\nBoard of Directors\n\nCareers\n\nLucid × Timothée Chalamet\n\nStories\n\nTech Talks\n\nInvestors\n\nSustainability\n\nLucid Technologies\n\n### More\n\nOwnership\n\nReferral Program\n\nAccessories\n\nContact Us\n\nLocations\n\nEvents\n\nMedia Room\n\nAwards and Accolades\n\nDisconnect Remote Vehicle Access\n\nKnowledge Center\n\n©2025 Lucid.

These include the\nsecondary systems you are using (like climate control, the infotainment\nsystem, in-seat massage, headlights, etc.), road conditions, outside\ntemperature, and how aggressively you drive. It also depends on your\nregenerative braking settings, which determine how much energy your vehicle\ncaptures and returns to the battery when your Lucid Air slows down.\n\nTips for maximizing range\n\n  * Set your regenerative braking setting to High by tapping Settings > Vehicle on the Pilot Panel and moving the slider to High, so your vehicle can re-capture the maximum amount of kinetic energy and charge your battery as you drive.\n\n  * Enable Automatic Seat & Steering Wheel Temp by going to your climate controls on the Pilot Panel, tapping the Settings button in the top-right, and turning the corresponding toggle on.\n\n  * Set your Drive Mode to Smooth, your Lucid Air’s range-optimized Drive Mode, on the Essentials screen on the Pilot Panel.\n\n  * Keep your windows closed to reduce drag.\n\n  * Avoid abrupt acceleration.\n\n  * Only travel with as much cargo as you need.\n\n  * Before a long trip, set your charge limit to Distance to get a full charge before you hit the road.\n\n### How do I link my Lucid Mobile Key?\n\nLucid’s Mobile Key allows you to use your smartphone (both iPhone and Android)\nas an access device to lock and unlock your doors and bring up your driver\nprofile. When enabled, your vehicle can do all of these things automatically\nas you either approach or walk away.\n\nFirst, you need to install the Lucid mobile app on your device to use Mobile\nKey (Tap for iPhone) (Tap for Android). For best results, make sure you’re\nusing the latest version of the app and your device’s operating system.\n\nFor detailed instructions on how to link your device, visit our Access & Keys\npage.\n\n### Does the Lucid New Vehicle Limited Warranty cover my tires?\n\nTo learn more about Lucid’s warranty and what it covers, visit our Lucid\nLimited Warranty page.\n\n### My key fob isn't working. What should I do?\n\nReasons your key fob might not be working\n\n  * Low battery – Your vehicle will display a Key Fob Battery Low notification on the Glass Cockpit if it detects a low key fob battery. If your battery dies, you can still use your key fob to unlock your doors by holding it above the camera on the driver’s side door pillar and lifting the door handle. To replace the key fob battery, check the instructions in your Owner’s Manual.\n\n  * Too far away – Your key fob range can be affected by many different factors. Use it as close as possible to your vehicle to ensure the best signal.\n\n  * Disconnected – Your key fob comes linked to your vehicle, but it’s possible for you to unlink it. Check your keys in Settings > Access & Profiles on the Pilot Panel, and if your key fob is no longer linked, link it to your profile by following the prompts on the display.\n\nIf none of these seems to be the issue, contact Customer Care for assistance.\n\n### How do I reset my profile PIN?\n\nWhen you access your vehicle using the Lucid key card or a key fob with a dead\nbattery, you need to enter your PIN for added security. PINs are unique to\neach profile, and Owner profile holders can set a Guest PIN that their\nfriends, valet drivers, or service technicians can use. Your vehicle also has\na unique default PIN that can’t be reset.\n\nTo reset your Lucid Air Owner Profile PIN\n\nWhen logged in to your Owner profile, on the Pilot Panel, tap Settings >\nAccess & Profiles. Under Profile Management, tap PIN, then Reset PIN. Enter\nyour Lucid ID password to confirm it’s you, then tap Confirm. You will be\nprompted to select a new PIN, then to enter it again to confirm. You will see\na message on the display that your PIN was successfully updated.\n\nIf you can’t remember your PIN when you’re being asked to enter it, you can\ntap the Reset PIN button. Enter your Lucid ID password to confirm it’s you,\nthen tap Confirm. You will be prompted to select a new PIN, then to enter it\nagain to confirm. You will see a message on the display that your PIN was\nsuccessfully updated.\n\nTo reset your Lucid Air Secondary Driver Profile PIN\n\nSecondary profiles must request approval from the Owner to reset their PIN.\nSecondary profiles will not have a Reset PIN option under Access & Profiles.\n\nIf you are logged in to a Secondary profile and are prompted to enter your PIN\non the Pilot Panel, you will also see a Reset PIN button. When tapped, the\nOwner profile holder will receive a notification via the Lucid mobile app\nasking to approve the PIN reset request. The Owner profile holder will have\ngive minutes to approve the request. Once the request is approved, you’ll be\nprompted to select a new PIN and to enter it again to confirm. You will see a\nmessage on the display that your PIN was successfully updated. If the request\nisn’t approved within five minutes, you’ll need to request permission again.\n\nTo reset the Lucid Air Guest PIN\n\nWhen logged in to the Owner profile, on the Pilot Panel, tap Settings > Access\n& Profiles. Under Profile Management, tap PIN, then Reset Guest PIN. Enter\nyour PIN to confirm it’s you. You will be prompted to select a new PIN, then\nto enter it again to confirm. You will see a message on the display that the\nGuest PIN was successfully updated.\n\n### What is the difference between Owner, Secondary, and Guest profiles?\n\nLucid profile types\n\nYour vehicle has three different profile types that provide different levels\nof access:\n\n  * Owner: The main profile type with access to all features, including the ability to add and remove other profiles. Each vehicle only has one Owner profile that is chosen at the time of purchase. If you need to change who the Owner profile holder is, contact Customer Care.\n\n  * Secondary: The profile type for up to three regular vehicle users other than the Owner. Secondary profiles can save their settings and sync with the Lucid mobile app.\n\n  * Guest: The profile type for anyone who needs temporary access or driving privileges. Preferred settings are not saved for this profile.\n\nFor detailed information on setting up and customizing these profiles, see\nyour Owner’s Manual.\n\n### How do I reset my Lucid ID password?\n\nTo reset the password associated with your Lucid ID, go to our Owner’s Portal,\nclick Forgot Your Password?, enter the email address associated with your\nLucid ID, then click Reset Password. You will receive an email with\ninstructions to reset your password.\n\n## Looking for something else?\n\nTell us in a few words.\n\n## Contact us\n\nWe’re here to help.\n\nContact\n\n### Lucid Air\n\nExplore Lucid Air\n\nCompare Vehicles\n\nPure\n\nTouring\n\nGrand Touring\n\nSapphire\n\nFleet\n\nDesign Yours\n\nAvailable Vehicles\n\nDemo Drive\n\n### Lucid Gravity\n\nExplore Lucid Gravity\n\nCompare Vehicles\n\nRoad to Lucid Gravity Videos\n\nDesign Yours\n\nAvailable Vehicles\n\nLucid Gravity Essentials\n\nStay Informed\n\nDemo Drive\n\n### Lucid Motors\n\nCompany\n\nLeadership\n\nBoard of Directors\n\nCareers\n\nLucid × Timothée Chalamet\n\nStories\n\nTech Talks\n\nInvestors\n\nSustainability\n\nLucid Technologies\n\n### More\n\nOwnership\n\nReferral Program\n\nAccessories\n\nContact Us\n\nLocations\n\nEvents\n\nMedia Room\n\nAwards and Accolades\n\nDisconnect Remote Vehicle Access\n\nKnowledge Center\n\n©2025 Lucid.

Your Lucid is compatible with the\nfastest EV chargers, like Electrify America’s 350 kW network, the most widely\navailable public chargers via the Tesla Supercharger network, and third-party\nnetworks like ChargePoint, EVgo, and more.\n\nLucid Gravity is capable of charging at up to 400 kW, while Lucid Air can\ncharge at up to 300 kW, letting you add an impressive amount of range in just\na few minutes, so you can spend more time heading out and less time plugging\nin.\n\nFor the most accurate range estimate based on how you’re driving and\nconvenient routing to the nearest charging stations when you need to plug in,\nuse the onboard Navigation app by tapping the Arrow button on the Glass\nCockpit. For even greater flexibility, bring a Lucid-approved adapter with\nyou, allowing you to charge up in even more places.\n\nFind Charging Stations\n\n## Public Charging Levels & Locations\n\nWhen you own a Lucid, you have no shortage of public charging options. The\nLucid Charging Service, which currently includes Electrify America and Tesla\nSuperchargers, helps you seamlessly access many public charging stations for\nextra convenience. You can also charge at other third-party stations, such as\nthose operated by EVgo and ChargePoint, outside of the Lucid Charging Service\nwith the corresponding mobile app.\n\n###  Charging Speed\n\nThe innovative technologies in Lucid Air and Lucid Gravity allow for\nimpressive charging speeds and compatibility with more charging networks with\nvarious outputs, letting you charge faster in more places. Charging speed is\naffected by many factors. Some of these are unique to your vehicle, such as:\n\n  * Your vehicle’s age and the condition of the battery\n\n  * How full your battery was when you started charging (your state of charge or battery level)\n\n  * Your battery temperature and whether you preconditioned your battery, and \n\n  * Your vehicle’s current and voltage limits\n\nOther factors are environmental, like the ambient temperature where you are\ncharging (extreme temperatures have a negative impact on charging speed).\n\nFinally, there are also factors that affect charging stations themselves, in\naddition to the ambient temperature:\n\n  * The charging stations’ maximum power output\n\n  * Charging station voltage (500V vs 1000V) \n\n  * The number of vehicles charging at the same time (the station load)\n\n  * Charger type (AC vs DC), and even \n\n  * Demand response from the grid operator, which may reduce power to help manage overall demand on the grid\n\nThe two easiest ways to improve your charging speed at public DC fast charging\nstations is by preconditioning your battery (either by enabling Smart\nPreconditioning or preconditioning your battery manually) and waiting until\nyour battery is relatively low before you plug in.\n\n### DC Fast Charging\n\nDC fast charging is what you’ll find at public fast charging stations, such as\nthose provided by Electrify America, Tesla, EVgo, ChargePoint, and others.\n\nAs its name suggests, DC fast charging is the fastest way to charge your\nvehicle. Instead of using alternating current, which is the current available\nin your home, DC charging uses direct current, which is the type of current\nstored in your battery, allowing it to be replenished faster.\n\nWhen using DC fast charging, your Lucid Air can accept up to 300 kW while\nLucid Gravity can accept up to 400 kW. For comparison, the Lucid Connected\nHome Charging Station charges at up to 19.2 kW. At public charging stations\nthat deliver up to 400 kW, you’ll see your estimated range increase very\nquickly. For example, at a typical DC fast charger, Lucid Air Grand Touring\ncan add up to 200 miles in approximately 12 minutes, just enough time to enjoy\na quick snack and freshen up before you get back on the road.¹ Lucid Gravity\nGrand Touring can add up to 200 miles in under 11 minutes.²\n\n### Level 2 Public Charging\n\nYou may find that your workplace, apartment building, and local businesses\nlike grocery stores and parking garages are equipped with public EV charging\nstations. These are very often level 2 alternating current (AC) charging\nstations that allow you to plug in and charge similarly to how you do at home.\nLevel 2 public charging stations typically deliver around 7 kW of power,\nletting you add range while you’re running errands, going to the movies, or\nenjoying a night out with your friends. These kinds of stations are\nincreasingly common from coast to coast and come from brands like ChargePoint,\nEV Connect, and others.\n\nTo charge at these third-party stations, you may need to use a smartphone app\nfor that brand of charging station or the screen on the charging station\nitself to pay for your session and start the flow of energy. Some stations may\neven be free to encourage you to visit the businesses that provide them. Check\nthe charging station for instructions on how to use it and how to pay, if\napplicable.\n\n## Lucid Charging Service\n\nThe Lucid Charging Service gives Lucid owners seamless access to an ever-\ngrowing network of more than 28,500 fast charging stations across North\nAmerica. You can easily view participating charging stations by searching the\nMap in the Lucid mobile app and adjusting your filters.\n\nDepending on when you purchased your vehicle, you may be enrolled in a Lucid\nCharging Plan with complimentary or discounted charging at one of Lucid’s\ncharging partners through the Lucid Charging Service. Even after your\napplicable promotional charging plan ends, the Lucid Charging Service makes\npublic charging quick and easy.\n\n### Lucid Wallet\n\nYour Lucid Wallet lets you manage your payment methods for a variety of Lucid\nservices, upgrades, and purchases, including public charging through the Lucid\nCharging Service. Without a valid payment method saved to your Lucid Wallet,\nyou will be unable to access the Lucid Charging Service or use Plug & Charge,\nwhere available.\n\nAdd a valid payment method in the Lucid mobile app, tap the Profile button >\nWallet. Alternatively, go to the Owner’s Portal and find your Lucid Wallet in\nthe Account Info tab.\n\n## Charging at Electrify America\n\nLucid has partnered with Electrify America to provide seamless fast charging\nfor Lucid owners at more than 4,800 DC fast charging stations around the\ncountry. Electrify America stations use CCS charging connectors that match the\ncombination J1772–CCS1 charge ports found in Lucid Air vehicles. Lucid Gravity\nowners will need their Lucid-approved CCS-to-NACS adapter to plug in at these\nstations.\n\n### Plug & Charge at Electrify America\n\nYour Lucid is equipped for Plug & Charge at Electrify America charging\nstations, allowing them to recognize your vehicle, initiate charging, and even\nprocess payment just by plugging in. Just add a payment method to your Lucid\nWallet and start charging your vehicle as soon as you plug in, without you\nneeding to repeatedly enter payment details or use a third-party app.\n\n## Charging at Tesla Superchargers\n\nLucid has also partnered with Tesla to provide Lucid owners with greater\nconvenience, faster charging, and more seamless access to the more than 23,500\nTesla Superchargers across North America, enabling public DC fast charging\nfrom coast to coast.\n\nLucid Gravity owners have a native North American Charging Standard (NACS)\ncharge port, allowing them to plug in to Tesla Superchargers without the need\nfor an adapter.\n\nLucid Air has a combination J1772–CCS1 charge port, which is different from\nthe North American Charging Standard (NACS) charge port. Lucid Air owners will\nneed a Lucid-approved adapter that supports DC fast charging to be able to\nplug in at Tesla Superchargers or to park at a stall that has a Magic Dock, a\nbuilt-in CCS adapter enabling non-Tesla EVs to use the Supercharger network.\n\n### Magic Docks\n\nMagic Docks are integrated CCS adapters at some Tesla Superchargers, enabling\nnon-Tesla EVs to use the Supercharger network. As a Lucid Air owner, you may\nbe able to use a Magic Dock to charge if your own Lucid-approved NACS-to-CCS\nadapter isn’t handy. For instructions on how to use a Magic Dock, visit the\nTesla website.\n\n### Supercharger Compatibility\n\nOnly newer-generation Superchargers (V3 and above) are capable of charging\nLucid vehicles. The easiest way to check station compatibility is to use the\nLucid mobile app to locate nearby Tesla Superchargers that are included in the\nLucid Charging Service. Compatible stations will appear in the app with a blue\nicon, while incompatible stations will appear as gray icons, and the station\ndetails will include a red Incompatible label.\n\n### Step 1. Search in the Lucid mobile app\n\nOpen the Lucid mobile app, tap the Arrow button at the bottom of the screen,\nthen tap the Charging Station button > Charging Filters and turn the Tesla\ntoggle on. Tap the × in the top-right corner to return to the map and see\nnearby stations.\n\n1 / 4\n\n### Parking Your Lucid at Tesla Superchargers\n\nLucid Gravity’s charge port is conveniently located in the same place as it\nwould be on a Tesla, so parking in a Tesla Supercharger stall is a breeze.\n\nTesla Superchargers were initially designed to accommodate Tesla vehicles and\noften have shorter charging cables than other public DC fast charging\nstations. Newer V4 Superchargers have longer cables to accommodate a wider\narray of EVs. Due to the placement of the Lucid Air charge port above the\nleft-front wheel, Lucid Air owners will need to pull forward into the charging\nstall, which means that at some Superchargers, your Air will extend into an\nadjacent stall.\n\nTips for parking at Tesla Superchargers:\n\n  * Check the signage, which may suggest specific stalls to use.\n\n  * Choose end stalls whenever possible, which often have more room for maneuvering and may reduce the likelihood of blocking an adjacent stall.\n\n  * Try to park so that the cable does not need to stretch too far.\n\n## Using Plug & Charge\n\nPlug & Charge allows compatible charging stations to recognize your vehicle,\nstart charging, and process payment whenever you plug in. Follow the\ninstructions below to use the Lucid mobile app to find Plug & Charge stations\nand seamlessly charge your vehicle. Before you begin, make sure a valid\npayment method is linked to your Lucid Wallet.\n\n### Step 1. Park at a compatible charging station\n\nUsing the Lucid mobile app, tap the Arrow button at the bottom of the screen,\nthen tap the Charging Station button > Charging Filters and turn the Electrify\nAmerica and Tesla toggles on. Route to and park at an available station. Note\nthat Lucid Air can currently only Plug & Charge at Electrify America.\n\n1 / 3\n\n### Plug & Charge at Tesla Superchargers\n\nLucid Gravity owners can take advantage of Plug & Charge convenience at Tesla\nSuperchargers the same way they can at Electrify America. Lucid Air does not\ncurrently support Plug & Charge at Tesla Superchargers, but owners can\ninitiate Supercharger charging sessions through the Lucid mobile app.\n\n## Plug & Charge Troubleshooting\n\nOccasionally, a charging station might not recognize your vehicle right away.\nWhen this happens, the words Authentication Error will appear on the Pilot\nPanel. When this happens, you can either:\n\n  1. Check that the station is working and move to another one, if necessary.\n\n  2. Initiate the charging session on the charging station display with a valid payment method.\n\n  3. Start the charging session using the Lucid mobile app.\n\n## Starting Charging Sessions in the Lucid Mobile App\n\nLucid owners can use the Lucid mobile app to pay for charging at station\nnetworks that participate in the Lucid Charging Service, either when Plug &\nCharge isn’t working or isn’t available.\n\nStep 1. Plug in and tap Select Station\n\nPlug in to a participating charging station. Your charging status will appear\nas Preparing to Charge on the Pilot Panel. In the Lucid mobile app, tap Select\nStation on the Charging screen.\n\n1 / 3\n\nIf you have trouble starting a charging session, contact the customer service\nnumber listed on the charging station for assistance.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### What is battery preconditioning?\n\nBattery preconditioning is a feature that lets you charge faster at DC fast\ncharging stations. When you activate battery preconditioning, it optimizes the\ntemperature of your high-voltage battery pack, so that it can accept a\nincoming energy more easily. This feature isn’t to be confused with cabin\npreconditioning, which we call Remote Climate.\n\n### How long should I precondition my battery?\n\nFor optimal preconditioning, enable Smart Preconditioning so your vehicle\nstarts preconditioning at the right time automatically when you use the Lucid\nNavigation app to route to a fast charging station.\n\nFor manual preconditioning, you can generally start about 20 minutes before\nyou intend to plug in to a DC fast charging station. You can start\npreconditioning up to 45 minutes before fast charging, but be mindful that\nyour vehicle may use more energy during this time to precondition your\nbattery.\n\n### How fast can Lucid charge at fast charging stations?\n\nDifferent Lucid models and trims can accept different amounts of power from\nfast charging stations. Lucid Air Pure can be charged at up to 250 kW, while\nLucid Air Grand Touring can be charged at up to 300 kW and Lucid Gravity Grand\nTouring can be charged at up to 400 kW. Charging power aside, how much range\nthis adds during your charging session depends on multiple factors, such as:\n\n  * How full your battery was when you started charging \n\n  * How hot or cold your battery is \n\n  * Whether you preconditioned your battery \n\n  * How much power the charging station you are using is actually delivering \n\n  * How often you use DC fast charging \n\nFor example, you could add up to 200 miles in only 12 minutes with a Lucid Air\nGrand Touring at DC fast charging stations.¹\n\n### Can I charge for free at Electrify America charging stations?\n\nIf you purchased or leased your Lucid Air before January 1, 2025, you may be\neligible for a non-transferrable, complimentary charging plan at Electrify\nAmerica charging stations in the United States. The exact parameters of your\ncomplimentary charging plan, such as duration and maximum charging limits,\nvary based on when you purchased or leased your vehicle and your specific\nvehicle trim. Those parameters should have been provided to you at delivery.\nIf you aren’t eligible for free charging, you can still charge at Electrify\nAmerica stations, but the applicable charging rate will apply, plus any taxes\nand fees.\n\n### Can I charge my Lucid Air at a Tesla Supercharger?\n\nYes, you can charge your Lucid Air at many Tesla Superchargers, which are\navailable to any EV with an appropriate adapter. Some Superchargers are\nreserved for Tesla vehicles, while others aren’t compatible with Lucid\nvehicles. You will be unable to plug in at these stations. You can confirm\ncompatibility by:\n\n  * Using the Lucid mobile app to locate an in-network Tesla Supercharger. \n\n  * Consulting with the provider directly for out-of-network chargers.\n\nTo charge your Lucid Air at a Tesla Supercharger, you will need a Lucid-\napproved adapter or Magic Dock and the Lucid mobile app.\n\n### Why does my Lucid Air only charge at 50 kW at Tesla Superchargers?\n\nLucid Air is designed with a cutting-edge, high-voltage architecture that\nenables ultra-fast charging at high-voltage charging stations. Many Tesla\nSuperchargers that are available to non-Tesla vehicles operate at\napproximately 400 volts, which is lower than Lucid Air’s 900+-volt capacity.\nAs a result of this voltage difference, Lucid Air relies on boost charging\nthrough its proprietary Wunderbox, which resolves the voltage difference but\nlimits output to 50 kW.\n\nLucid Gravity, on the other hand, can charge at up to 225 kW at Tesla\nSuperchargers thanks to its proprietary boost charging technology, which\nleverages the vehicle’s rear drive unit.\n\n### Can I use third-party charging stations to charge my Lucid?\n\nYou can charge your Lucid at most third-party charging stations, provided you\nhave an appropriate adapter (if applicable) and either the station provider’s\nmobile app or a way to pay for the session before starting. See the charging\nstation itself or the provider’s website for details.\n\n### Why is my Lucid Charging Service charging session not starting?\n\nIf you are trying to charge at a pubic charging station with the Lucid\nCharging Service but are unable to initiate a session, try the following:\n\n  * Make sure you are logged in to the Lucid mobile app and your vehicle has been added. \n\n  * Make sure you have an active Lucid Charging Service account by tapping the **Charging** tile > **Lucid Charging Service**. \n\n  * Make sure Plug & Charge is enabled, if applicable. \n\n  * Make sure a payment method has been added to your account by tapping the **Profile** icon> **Wallet**. \n\nOnce you’ve verified that these conditions are met, try charging again by\nunplugging your vehicle and waiting a minute for the charger to reset. Check\nthat the charge port is free of any debris or anything that may be blocking a\nconnection, then plug in again.\n\n### How much will it cost to charge my Lucid?\n\nMuch like gas, the cost of charging your Lucid can change depending on where\nyou live because the cost of energy varies widely across the country. In many\nmarkets, the cost to completely recharge your EV may still less than filling\nup the gas tank of a similar internal combustion engine car, resulting in\npotential savings over time.\n\nSome public AC charging stations may be completely free because they’re\nprovided by workplaces and businesses as a perk for employees and customers.\nOthers, particularly DC fast chargers, charge for the energy they provide, and\nthe cost can vary considerably.\n\n### Why is charging priced on a per-kWh basis at some charging stations and on\na per-minute basis at others?\n\nEach charging station provider can decide how they want to charge their\ncustomers. Pricing on a per-minute basis means pricing based on how long the\ncharger was delivering energy to the EV. Pricing on a per-kWh basis means\npricing based on how much energy the charger delivered to the EV. Check the\ncharging station’s pricing before plugging in. Lucid does not control how\nthird parties manage their pricing.\n\n### What is a Lucid Charging Service payment issue?\n\nIf you’ve received a payment issue push notification or email, Lucid was\nunable to charge you for a charging session because your default payment\nmethod has expired, been canceled, or been suspended. Your Lucid Charging\nService account will be placed on hold and you will be unable to initiate a\ncharging session through the Lucid mobile app or Plug & Charge until you\nresolve the payment issue.\n\nGo to the Lucid Charging Service screen to manage your account and re-process\npayment.\n\nIf you need to update your default payment method, you can do so in your Lucid\nWallet. While you wait for your account to be restored, you can pay for\ncharging directly using the payment method of your choice at the charging\nstation.\n\n### Why is there a hold on my credit card when I use the Lucid Charging\nService?\n\nWhen you use the Lucid Charging Service, a temporary hold may be placed on\nyour credit card to ensure you have sufficient funds available to cover the\ntransaction. For example, a hold attributed to Lucid SW Sales, Lucid EV\ncharging, or something similar may be placed before you start charging to make\nsure the full cost of the session can be covered.\n\nOnce your charging session ends and the full cost of the session is finalized,\nthe temporary hold will be released. Typically, the length of these holds can\nvary depending on your bank. Most holds are released within 2 to 4 days, but\nthis can change according to the bank that issued your credit card and the\nmerchant involved. Holds may take up to a week to be reversed, especially\nduring weekends or holidays. If you think a hold has remained on your card in\nerror, contact your bank first to ask about the hold. If they tell you that\nyou need to contact Lucid, you can contact Customer Care.\n\n## Looking for something else?\n\nTell us in a few words.\n\n## Contact us\n\nWe’re here to help.\n\nContact\n\n### Lucid Air\n\nExplore Lucid Air\n\nCompare Vehicles\n\nPure\n\nTouring\n\nGrand Touring\n\nSapphire\n\nFleet\n\nDesign Yours\n\nAvailable Vehicles\n\nDemo Drive\n\n### Lucid Gravity\n\nExplore Lucid Gravity\n\nCompare Vehicles\n\nRoad to Lucid Gravity Videos\n\nDesign Yours\n\nAvailable Vehicles\n\nLucid Gravity Essentials\n\nStay Informed\n\nDemo Drive\n\n### Lucid Motors\n\nCompany\n\nLeadership\n\nBoard of Directors\n\nCareers\n\nLucid × Timothée Chalamet\n\nStories\n\nTech Talks\n\nInvestors\n\nSustainability\n\nLucid Technologies\n\n### More\n\nOwnership\n\nReferral Program\n\nAccessories\n\nContact Us\n\nLocations\n\nEvents\n\nMedia Room\n\nAwards and Accolades\n\nDisconnect Remote Vehicle Access\n\nKnowledge Center\n\n©2025 Lucid.

Find a route home, adjust your\nclimate controls, call a loved one, or check the weather, all with a native\napplication that comes standard on your Lucid, no extra logins or accounts\nrequired.\n\n## Setting up Lucid Assistant\n\nLucid Assistant is available on all vehicles running Software Version 2.4.0\nand above.\n\nLucid Assistant is enabled by default. To access your Lucid Assistant\nsettings, tap the Gear button on the Pilot Panel, then tap Applications >\nLucid Assistant. You can customize your settings by adjusting the toggles on\nthis screen. For example, to be able to invoke Lucid Assistant using the\nphrase “Hey Lucid”, turn the Lucid Hands-Free toggle on. Otherwise, invoke it\nat any time using the steering wheel button.\n\nIf you decide you do not want to use Lucid Assistant, turn the Lucid Assistant\ntoggle off.\n\nRead more about Lucid Assistant in your Owner’s Manual.\n\nOwners Manual\n\n### Setting up calling and texting\n\nIf you’d like Lucid Assistant to be able to make calls and send messages to\nyour contacts, you need to give Lucid Assistant permission to access them. To\ndo this, go to Settings > Connectivity > Bluetooth and find the list of paired\ndevices. Find your device and tap the three dots next to your phone’s name.\nTurn the Sync Messages and Sync Contacts toggles on. Then in the Lucid\nAssistant settings, tap Communication and turn the Allow Lucid Assistant to\nAccess Contacts toggle on.\n\n## Invoking Lucid Assistant\n\nWhenever you want to invoke Lucid Assistant:\n\n  * Say “Hey Lucid”, or\n\n  * Press the Voice button on the right side of the steering wheel\n\nWhen using your voice, speak normally and clearly. Your vehicle’s microphone\nwill capture your question or command, and Lucid Assistant will respond. If it\ndidn’t hear you, or if it needs additional information, it will let you know.\n\n## Using Lucid Assistant\n\nLucid Assistant lets you complete key tasks while minimizing potential\ndistractions.\n\nUse it to:\n\nBy saying phrases like:\n\nHelp you navigate\n\nHey Lucid, take me home.  \nWhat’s the most scenic route to Napa Valley?  \nShow me restaurants nearby. Take me to the first one on the list.\n\nAdjust your climate controls\n\nHey Lucid, turn on the AC.  \nSet the fan speed to 2.  \nTurn on Creature Comfort Mode.\n\nMake calls and send texts\n\nHey Lucid, call Morgan Young.  \nCall 844-367-7787.  \nText Kyle.\n\nControl your audio\n\nHey Lucid, play ‘California Dreamin’ by the Mamas and the Papas on Spotify.¹  \nPlay 92.9 FM.  \nTurn the volume up.\n\nLearn more about your vehicle\n\nHey Lucid, help me link my Mobile Key.  \nHow do I disable Lane Departure Protection?  \nWhat is the Sprint Drive Mode and how do I change it?\n\nAnswer general knowledge questions\n\nHey Lucid, what is the most popular winery in Napa Valley?  \nWhat color is the Golden Gate Bridge?  \nHow many people live in California?\n\nEntertain you and your passengers\n\nHey Lucid, tell me a joke.  \nWrite a short poem about electric vehicles.\n\n## Lucid Assistant Limitations\n\nKnowledge-based questions require an internet connection. If you don’t have\ninternet, you can still use Lucid Assistant for car controls.\n\nNote that Lucid’s Alexa support has been discontinued.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### Lucid Assistant General Information\n\n### What can I use Lucid Assistant for?\n\nLucid Assistant is an AI-enabled, voice-activated digital assistant that can\nhelp you with a variety of tasks, like:\n\n  * Making calls\n\n  * Sending texts\n\n  * Queuing up your favorite podcast or music\n\n  * Checking the weather\n\n  * Adjusting your climate controls\n\n  * Answering knowledge-based questions about anything and everything (including your vehicle)\n\n  * Completing creative tasks, like telling you a story or joke, writing a poem, or inventing a new song\n\nSee below to learn about Lucid Assistant’s limitations, including connectivity\nrequirements. Lucid Assistant is continuously improving with every applicable\nsoftware update. Check your OTA release notes for any new Lucid Assistant\nupdates or features.\n\n### Is there a list of commands I can use with Lucid Assistant?\n\nLucid Assistant is powered by artificial intelligence (AI), which means that\nit processes and uses natural language, the kind you use to talk to the people\naround you. This means that there is a near-infinite number of possible\ncommands you can use, so you don’t need to memorize a set list. For example,\nif you can’t remember what to say to change your climate controls, no problem:\nyou can say something as simple as, “Hey Lucid, it’s hot in here,” and your\nvehicle will understand and adjust your climate controls accordingly. If your\nvehicle does not understand a command, it will ask you to clarify. You can see\nmore examples of the commands in the Using Lucid Assistant section.\n\n### Features and Functionality\n\n### I have a question about my vehicle. Can Lucid Assistant help answer it?\n\nYes, Lucid Assistant is able to answer knowledge-based questions about your\nvehicle based on what’s written in your Owner’s Manual. For example, you might\nask, “Hey Lucid, how do I activate Sprint Mode?” or “What does Creature\nComfort Mode do?”\n\n### What languages can I use with Lucid Assistant?\n\nLucid Assistant is currently available in English, Spanish, French, and\nArabic. We are continuously working to add support for new languages,\nprioritizing the languages that are already available on the in-car displays.\n\n### I like using Apple CarPlay and Siri in my Lucid. Does Lucid Assistant work\nat the same time?\n\nLucid Assistant can work at the same time as CarPlay, with one exception: when\nCarPlay is active, Lucid Assistant is unable to send messages on your behalf,\nbut it can still make phone calls. For both features to work together, make\nsure your phone is paired with your vehicle using Bluetooth. Other Lucid\nAssistant features (car controls, media controls, etc.) will still work while\nCarPlay is active.\n\n### Does Lucid Assistant need internet connectivity?\n\nConnectivity is required to access information that is not stored on your\nvehicle. For example, all knowledge-based questions require connectivity, but\ncar controls (for example, adjusting your climate settings or media), making\ncalls, sending texts, navigating using Offline Maps, etc. are available\nwithout connectivity.\n\n### Can I use Lucid Assistant to help me navigate while I am driving?\n\nYes, Lucid Assistant gives you hands-free access to your vehicle’s onboard\nNavigation app. Simply invoke Lucid Assistant and tell it where you want to\ngo, for example: “Hey Lucid, take me to the nearest coffee shop.” If you would\nlike Lucid Assistant to take you home or to work, these addresses must be pre-\nprogrammed and saved to your profile, otherwise you will need to specify the\naddress.\n\n### Lucid Assistant doesn’t support all car controls. Can I expect it to\nsupport more car controls in the future?\n\nLucid is continuously working to improve Lucid Assistant and the breadth of\ncommands it supports. While some car controls are currently unavailable, our\nteams are working to add more in the future.\n\n### Troubleshooting and Tips\n\n### Why is Lucid Assistant turning on when I didn’t ask it anything?\n\nVoice activation for Lucid Assistant is sensitive. You may find that you are\ninvoking Lucid Assistant by accident by saying words or phrases that sound\nsimilar to the phrase “Hey Lucid.” If this happens too frequently, you can\ndisable voice activation in Settings by turning the Lucid Hands-Free toggle\noff. This will also prevent passengers from being able to invoke Lucid\nAssistant, because you will only be able to invoke it with the Voice button on\nthe steering wheel.\n\n### Lucid Assistant doesn’t seem to hear me well and does not turn on when I\nsay, “Hey Lucid.” What else can I try?\n\nFor best results, say “Hey Lucid” in a clear, confident voice while looking\nforward over your steering wheel. If you say “Hey Lucid” while looking over\nyour shoulder, the microphone used to detect your voice might not pick it up.\nIf you continue having trouble, you can invoke Lucid Assistant with the Voice\nbutton on the steering wheel instead.\n\n### I noticed I can’t ask Lucid Assistant to call my saved contacts. What’s\nwrong?\n\nLucid Assistant needs special permission to access the contacts on your phone.\nMake sure your phone is paired with your vehicle using Bluetooth, then go to\nSettings > Applications > Lucid Assistant > Communication and make sure the\nAllow Lucid Assistant to Access Contacts toggle is turned on. You may also\nneed to enable contact syncing in the Bluetooth settings on your phone.\n\n### I tried playing my favorite song using Lucid Assistant, but it didn’t\nwork. What’s wrong?\n\nTry the following steps to resolve this issue:\n\nFirst, Lucid Assistant can only play media using supported third-party apps.\nSee question for third-party apps below. If you are asking Lucid Assistant to\nuse a different app, it will be unable to do so.\n\nSecond, you must be signed in to an active account for many of these apps to\nwork. You can sign in to these apps in Settings > Applications. If you are not\nsigned in, Lucid Assistant will be unable to use the app to play any media.\n\nThird, you need connectivity to access these third-party apps in your vehicle.\nIf you are in an area without connectivity or do not have a connectivity plan,\nyou will be unable to access media sources other than FM radio, USB, or any\nmedia stored on devices you have paired with or connected to your vehicle.\n\nFinally, to help Lucid Assistant play your favorite track on the right app,\nconsider saying, “Hey Lucid, play ‘California Dreamin’ by the Mamas and the\nPapas on Spotify” (or other app name) so that it knows which app to use.\n\nIf you continue having trouble, try logging out of the third-party app,\nlogging back in, and trying again.\n\n### Privacy\n\n### Is Lucid Assistant listening to me or recording me when I’m not using it?\n\nLucid Assistant is primed and ready to recognize the phrase “Hey Lucid” and\nwake up to help you, but it does not listen to or transmit your conversations\nor record your speech for any reason.\n\n### Will Lucid use my responses to target advertisements or market content to\nme based on my conversations?\n\nAt Lucid, customer privacy is of paramount importance, and Lucid Assistant is\nno exception. Under no circumstances does Lucid Assistant record the content\nof in-car conversations, use in-car conversations or personal information for\nad targeting purposes, or deliver advertisements. Any ad that you see or hear\non a third-party platform that resembles a topic you discussed while using\nLucid Assistant is purely coincidental.\n\n### Accessibility and Limitations\n\n### I do not want to use Lucid Assistant. How do I disable it?\n\nYou can turn off Lucid Assistant by going to Settings > Applications > Lucid\nAssistant and tapping the Lucid Assistant toggle off. If you decide you do\nwant to use Lucid Assistant, toggle it back on at any time.\n\n### What third-party media apps can I use with Lucid Assistant?\n\nCurrently, Lucid Assistant only works with the media apps available on the\nPilot Panel: Spotify, TIDAL, TuneIn Radio, Sirius XM Radio, iHeartRadio, and\nFM radio. We are continuously working to add more apps in the future. Stay\ntuned! Note that, previously, Amazon Music users could access their music\nthrough Alexa, which is no longer available in Lucid vehicles.\n\n### Is Alexa still available on my Lucid vehicle?\n\nLucid vehicles no longer support Alexa.\n\n### Does Lucid Assistant support any smart home devices?\n\nLucid Assistant does not currently support smart home devices.\n\n## Looking for something else?\n\nTell us in a few words.\n\n## Contact us\n\nWe’re here to help.\n\nContact\n\n### Lucid Air\n\nExplore Lucid Air\n\nCompare Vehicles\n\nPure\n\nTouring\n\nGrand Touring\n\nSapphire\n\nFleet\n\nDesign Yours\n\nAvailable Vehicles\n\nDemo Drive\n\n### Lucid Gravity\n\nExplore Lucid Gravity\n\nCompare Vehicles\n\nRoad to Lucid Gravity Videos\n\nDesign Yours\n\nAvailable Vehicles\n\nLucid Gravity Essentials\n\nStay Informed\n\nDemo Drive\n\n### Lucid Motors\n\nCompany\n\nLeadership\n\nBoard of Directors\n\nCareers\n\nLucid × Timothée Chalamet\n\nStories\n\nTech Talks\n\nInvestors\n\nSustainability\n\nLucid Technologies\n\n### More\n\nOwnership\n\nReferral Program\n\nAccessories\n\nContact Us\n\nLocations\n\nEvents\n\nMedia Room\n\nAwards and Accolades\n\nDisconnect Remote Vehicle Access\n\nKnowledge Center\n\n©2025 Lucid.

Approaching the End of Your Lease\n\n  * Call your Lucid Sales Specialist or reach out to Sales at +1 (844) 367-7787 to discuss the latest Lucid vehicle offerings and options to continue your Lucid ownership. \n\n  * Review the Lucid Excess Wear and Use Guidelines.\n\n  * Schedule your free vehicle pre-inspection by contacting Openlane (formerly AutoVIN) at +1 (800) 556-2811 or online through https://inspections.openlane.com/, within the final 3 months of your lease term. \n\n    * There will be a final lease inspection, conducted after vehicle return, which may identify additional items not present during the pre-inspection. Customers remain responsible for all final lease-end charges. \n\n  * If the pre-inspection shows any Excess Wear and Use that you would prefer to address prior to returning your lease, please contact your Lucid Service & Delivery Center to schedule an appointment or arrangements to make any required repairs to minimize end of term liability. In some cases, your personal auto insurance may cover some of the necessary repairs. You will need to work with your insurance company to find out if that is a possibility for you. \n\n### Step 2. Scheduling your Lease Return\n\n  * Your vehicle is expected to be returned at a Lucid Service & Delivery Center. \n\n  * Please note that an abandoned vehicle may have additional charges incurred. \n\n  * You may not return to a non-Lucid location, including other manufacturers’ dealerships. \n\n  * Schedule your lease return by contacting your Lucid Sales Specialist or reach out to Sales at +1 (844) 367-7787. \n\n### Step 3.

The vehicle must be logged in to the owner’s profile, charged at least 50%, and in Park to perform the reset. \n\n  * Please remember to return all items that were provided with your vehicle when you first leased it to avoid being charged for the item (for example: all keycards and key fobs, owner's manuals, cargo covers, spare tires/tools, charge cables, etc.) \n\n  * Contact your local Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) for any state license and/or registration requirements. \n\n### Step 4. Turning in Your Vehicle\n\n  * Validate your identity with our Lucid representative via ID. \n\n  * Complete the Odometer Disclosure Statement and Lease Turn-In form which will be provided by your Lucid representative. \n\n  * Please retain a copy of your grounding documents. \n\n  * For additional information, please refer to our Lease End Frequently Asked Questions. \n\n### Step 5. After Turning in Your Vehicle\n\n  * Cancel recurring payments as we cannot stop these on your behalf. \n\n  * A final inspection will be performed by a 3rd party to evaluate Excess Wear and Use. \n\n  * Your final inspection report will be shared with you after completion. \n\n  * Any Excess Wear & Use charges will be added to your lease-end bill. \n\n## Lucid Excess Wear and Use Guidelines\n\n### Glass and Lenses\n\n###### Glass: Any scratch, chip, pit, or crack in the windshield or other\nglass surfaces.

The vehicles in the Lucid Air family have some of the longest range\nof all the EVs on the market today, with the Lucid Air Grand Touring boasting\nan EPA estimated range of up to 512 miles on a single charge.¹ Not only that,\nLucid’s unique Wunderbox, when paired with our 900V+ architecture, lets you\ncharge faster than you can even imagine—up to 200 miles in only 12 minutes\nwith certain trims at DC fast charging stations.² You can charge your Lucid\nAir at almost all public EV charging stations, including Tesla Superchargers\nwith a Lucid-approved adapter.\n\nLucid Air is also capable of bidirectional vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) charging³,\nwhich means that with the Lucid RangeXchange adapter, you can share your\nvehicle’s energy with other EVs, including both Lucid and non-Lucid vehicles.\n\nTo learn more about charging, visit our Charging page.\n\n## Charge Port\n\nYour Lucid Air has a J1772 (CCS1) charge port. The J1772 connector allows you\nto use Level 1 and Level 2 AC (alternating current) charging at home, while\nthe CCS1 combo connector allows you to use DC (direct current) fast charging\nat third-party charging stations all over the country.\n\n### Opening and Closing\n\nYour Lucid Air’s charge port is located between the driver’s side door and the\nleft-front wheel.\n\nHere are all the ways to open and close it when your vehicle is unlocked:\n\n### Tap the charge port icon on the Left Cockpit Panel\n\n1 / 5\n\n## Lucid Air and the North American Charging Standard (NACS)\n\nLucid has partnered with Tesla to provide Lucid Air owners with greater\nconvenience, faster charging, and more seamless access to the more than 23,500\nTesla Superchargers across North America, enabling DC fast charging in even\nmore places.\n\nLucid Air has a combination J1772–CCS1 charge port, which is different from\nthe North American Charging Standard (NACS) charge port. NACS was initially\nexclusive to Tesla vehicles, but it has now been standardized as SAE J3400 and\nopened up for use by other automakers, including Lucid.\n\nWhile you can easily charge your Air at Tesla Superchargers, you will need a\nLucid-approved adapter that supports DC charging to be able to plug in. When\nyou arrive at a Tesla Supercharger, simply connect your adapter to the\ncharging connector, plug in to your vehicle, and initiate the charging session\nthrough the Lucid mobile app.\n\n## NACS Adapters for Lucid Air\n\nNACS charging connectors are designed for both AC and DC charging with a\nsingle charge port, providing extra flexibility and convenience. The Lucid Air\nhas a two-in-one charge port, with a J1772 port for Level 1 and Level 2 AC\ncharging and a CCS1 port for DC fast charging. This means that, depending on\nhow and where you want to charge, you may need two NACS adapters: one for AC\ncharging and one for DC charging.\n\nNote: It’s very important to use the appropriate adapter for the type of\ncharging you’re doing. Using the wrong adapter could pose a safety risk, void\nyour vehicle’s warranty, and even damage your vehicle’s charging system.\n\nLucid-approved NACS-to-CCS charging adapters are available for purchase from\nthe US Lucid Store and may be shipped to Canada. Pricing is in US dollars and\nexcludes tax. You may be able to find third-party adapters from other\nretailers, but we recommend only using Lucid-approved adapters, which are\ncertified and thoroughly tested for safety and compatibility. Lucid adapters\nhave built-in safety features to ensure they operate correctly and protect\nagainst electrical hazards. Third-party adapters may not have been tested to\nthe same standards, and using them may lead to charging issues or potentially\neven damage your Lucid Air’s charging system.\n\nYou can check whether a DC fast charger where you want to charge requires an\nadapter in the Lucid mobile Navigation app, which lists charging connector\ntype in the station details and whether an adapter is needed for your Air.\n\n## Connecting your NACS-to-CCS Adapter\n\nFollow these steps to use Lucid-approved adapters for your Lucid Air. The\ninstructions for connecting AC and DC adapters are the same:\n\n### Step 1.\n\nFirmly insert the NACS charging connector into the corresponding opening on\nthe adapter until you hear a click. Check that the adapter is fully and\ntightly connected and make sure you are using the correct adapter for the type\nof charging you are doing, either AC or DC.\n\n1 / 3\n\nOnce you’re done charging, make sure to tap Stop Charging on the Pilot Panel\nor in the Lucid mobile app to stop the flow of energy and unlock the charging\ncable from the vehicle. Then firmly pull the charging connector and adapter\nout of the charge port. Press the unlock button on the charging connector\nhandle to unlock the adapter, then pull to remove it. Remember to bring it\nwith you by returning it to where you usually store it.\n\nMore Tips About NACS Charging\n\nNACS-to-CCS adapter\n\nPurchase\n\n## Plugging In and Unplugging\n\nFor safety, your Lucid Air will remain in Park whenever a charging cable is\nconnected.\n\nWhether you’re charging at home or on the road, the instructions for plugging\nin are the same. Insert the charging connector gently and completely into the\ncharge port. Once inserted, the charging cable locks in place to prevent you\nfrom removing it while high-voltage energy is flowing.\n\nIf you need to unplug before charging is complete, tap Stop Charging on the\nPilot Panel or in the Lucid mobile app. To remove the charging cable, hold it\nfirmly with one hand. If the charging connector has a release button, press it\ngently with your thumb, then pull it straight out of the charge port. Return\nthe charging connector to its dock if you are at a public fast charging\nstation or drape the cable over your Lucid Connected Home Charging Station for\nfuture use.\n\nIn the event the button does not release the charging cable, you can find\ninstructions on manually releasing the charging cable in your Owner’s Manual.\nThis method should only be used as a last resort.\n\n## Charging Status\n\nYou can monitor your charging status in several ways:\n\n### 1\\. Charge port lights\n\n1 / 3\n\n### Charge Port Lights\n\nYour charge port lights are an easy way to know your charging status at a\nglance. Here’s what they mean:\n\nCharge Port Light Color\n\nWhat It Means\n\nWhite (solid)\n\nReady to charge\n\nWhite (pulsing)\n\nCharging pending\n\nGreen (pulsing)\n\nCharging in progress\n\nGreen (solid)\n\nCharging complete\n\nRed (solid)\n\nCharging error\n\n## Charging Screen\n\nYour Lucid Air’s Charging screen is the power command center of your vehicle.\nTo get here, tap the Vehicle button, then tap Charging on the Pilot Panel.\n\nThis is what your Charging screen looks like when your vehicle isn’t plugged\nin.\n\nWhen your vehicle is charging, you’ll find additional information here to help\nyou monitor your charging session and know exactly how fast you’re charging,\nso you can estimate when you’ll reach your charge limit and get back on the\nroad.\n\n## Charging Limit\n\nYour charge limit is how full you want your battery to be before charging\nstops.\n\nBattery-powered devices, including your Lucid Air, generally don’t need to be\ncharged to 100% very often. That’s because EV batteries operate most\nefficiently when they are charged in the 20% to 80% range. Staying within this\nrange as much as possible helps keep your battery working better for longer.\nLucid Air has two preset charge limits: Daily and Distance.\n\n### Daily Charge Limit\n\nThe Daily charge limit begins at 50% and goes to 80%. Tap Set Charge Limit on\nthe Charging screen, use your finger to move the slider to the desired\npercentage, and tap Done.  \n  \nThanks to Lucid Air’s industry-leading range, an 80% charge may get you to\nmost of the places you would want to go on a normal day.\n\n### Distance Charge Limit\n\nLike its name suggests, the Distance charge limit is meant for when you really\nneed to go the distance. Right before a long drive, move the slider to\nDistance, select your desired percentage, and tap Done.  \n  \nRemember, you only need to charge to 100% before a long drive. Charging to\n100% too often or letting the battery sit with a full charge can stress it and\nlead to accelerated degradation over time.\n\n## Battery Preconditioning\n\nBattery preconditioning is a feature that optimizes the temperature of your\nhigh-voltage battery pack. When your battery pack is at the right temperature,\nit can accept a charge faster at DC fast charging stations. This means that if\nyour battery is either too hot or too cold, for example due to the weather, it\nwill charge less efficiently. In cold weather environments, preconditioning\nwarms your battery. In hot weather environments, preconditioning cools it.\n\n### Optimizing Fast Charging\n\nFollow these steps to precondition your battery before fast charging.\n\n1\\. About 20 minutes before you intend to plug in, tap Start Preconditioning\non the Charging screen. Read the Before You Start instructions, then tap\nConfirm.\n\n2\\. Your battery will begin preconditioning en route to the charging station.\n\n3\\. If you enable Smart Preconditioning, when you use your Lucid Air’s\nNavigation app to route to a fast charging station, your vehicle will start\npreconditioning at the right time automatically based on your estimated time\nof arrival.\n\n4\\. When you arrive at the charging station, even if your charging status\nindicator still says Preconditioning, feel free to plug in right away and\nstart charging.\n\nBattery preconditioning uses energy from the battery to optimize its\ntemperature. If your battery is already very low, preconditioning will be\ndisabled to conserve energy and preserve range to help you reach a charging\nstation.\n\nMany factors affect how fast your vehicle charges. Preconditioning is one way\nto potentially improve charging speeds.\n\n### Improving Cold Weather Performance\n\nAnother benefit of battery preconditioning is improved cold weather\nperformance. When your battery pack is cold, it doesn’t transfer energy as\nefficiently, which can affect range and vehicle performance. As you drive,\nyour battery will warm up on its own, but by preconditioning your battery\nbefore you drive, you will notice less of an effect of the cold weather on\nyour driving.\n\nWhen it’s freezing outside, use Remote Climate in the Lucid mobile app to warm\nyour cabin and start battery preconditioning at the same time. Your drive will\nbe much more comfortable.\n\n### Smart Preconditioning\n\nYour Lucid Air is unique in that it allows you to control when you\nprecondition your battery. It can also precondition your battery for you\nthanks to Smart Preconditioning, so you don’t even have to think about it.\n\nFrom the Charging screen, tap the Settings button in the top right to open\nyour Advanced Charging Settings.\n\nHere, you’ll find a Smart Preconditioning toggle. Tap it to turn it on, and\nthen whenever you are navigating to a fast charging station using the Lucid\nNavigation app, your vehicle will start preconditioning your battery\nautomatically based on when you’ll arrive at the station.\n\n## Charging at Tesla Superchargers\n\nTesla Superchargers are now linked to the Lucid Charging Service and your\nLucid mobile app. Your existing account grants you charging access at\ncompatible in-network Superchargers. If you don’t already have one, Lucid\nCharging Service accounts are free to open—all you need is a valid payment\nmethod added to your Lucid Wallet. To add a payment method, open the Lucid\nmobile app, tap the Profile button, tap Wallet, and then tap the “+” icon in\nthe top-right corner of the screen. You can also add a payment method in the\nOwner’s Portal.\n\nWhen you arrive at a Tesla Supercharger, simply connect your adapter, plug in,\nand initiate your charging session through the Lucid mobile app.\n\nTo learn more about identifying compatible Tesla Superchargers, please visit\nour public charging page.\n\n## Lucid Charging Service\n\nDepending on when you bought your vehicle, you may be eligible for\ncomplimentary or discounted charging at one of Lucid’s charging partners\nthrough the Lucid Charging Service. Complimentary or not, the Lucid Charging\nService gives Lucid owners access to an ever-growing network of more than\n28,500 charging stations across North America. You can easily view\nparticipating charging stations using the search feature on the Maps page in\nthe Lucid mobile app or in the Navigation app on the Pilot Panel. For now, it\nis only possible to search for in-network Tesla Superchargers in the Lucid\nmobile app.\n\nAfter your applicable promotional charging plan ends, you can enroll in the\nLucid Charging Service to meet your public charging needs. Log in to your\nOwner’s Portal to view your charging plan options and enroll or upgrade your\nservice. If your vehicle was delivered after January 1, 2025, you were\nautomatically enrolled in the Lucid Charging Service at the time of delivery.\nJust make sure to add a valid payment method in your Lucid Wallet to begin\nusing it. If you don’t have an account yet, you can easily open one in your\nOwner’s Portal.\n\nIf you are eligible for complimentary charging at Electrify America, this\nbenefit does not transfer to Tesla Superchargers.\n\n## Scheduled Charging\n\nGenerally, when you plug your Lucid Air in, charging will begin right away.\n\nScheduled Charging lets you choose exactly when you’d like to charge, giving\nyou extra control over your charging schedule and energy usage. For example,\nScheduled Charging allows you to charge at specific times to take advantage of\noff-peak utility rates while giving you the confidence that your battery will\nbe charged when you’re ready to go.\n\n### Scheduling Your Charging Sessions\n\nYou’ll find the Scheduled Charging settings on the Charging screen on the\nPilot Panel.\n\nTo enable Scheduled Charging, tap Schedule Charging at the bottom of the\ndisplay.\n\nFirst, select the location where you would like your charging schedule to\napply. Most drivers choose their home address, as this is where they charge\ntheir vehicle most often. This allows your charging schedule to apply\nautomatically when you are parked at this location, but allows you to start\ncharging immediately everywhere else, such as public fast charging stations.\n\nNext, after setting your location, use the time picker to select when you\nwould like charging to start. For example, this could be when your local\nutility switches to off-peak hours, allowing you to plug in as soon as you get\nhome but delay charging until electricity is more affordable. The words\nCharging Scheduled will appear on the Pilot Panel and in the Lucid mobile app\nwhenever you are plugged in, and your charging session will begin at the\nscheduled time.\n\nYour selected Scheduled Charging program will display on the Charging screen\nat all times for easy reference. To edit it, tap the scheduled time, select a\nnew location or time, and tap Confirm.\n\nIf you want to turn Scheduled Charging off, just tap the toggle and the\nfeature will be disabled until you enable it again.\n\n### Scheduled Charging and Digital AC Chargers\n\nLucid Air’s Scheduled Charging feature is not compatible with AC chargers that\ncommunicate digitally with your vehicle due to the technical limitations of\nthese charging stations. Even if you enable Scheduled Charging and set a\ncharging time, when you plug in to a digital AC charging station, charging\nwill begin immediately. You will receive a push notification to alert you that\nyour vehicle is charging, so that you can decide to unplug or stop charging\nfrom the Lucid mobile app.\n\nTo identify whether your home’s AC charger is a digital AC charger, check the\ntechnical documentation or spec sheet that came with it. If it states that the\ncharger supports ISO15118 communication, it’s a digital charger and will not\nwork with Lucid’s Scheduled Charging feature.\n\n## Ensuring Long-Term Lucid Air Battery Health\n\nLike all batteries, your Lucid Air battery will change over time. How you\ncharge can affect your long-term battery health, and adopting good charging\nbehaviors can extend your battery’s useful life.\n\n### Charge Limits\n\nYour Lucid Air battery operates most efficiently in the range of 20% to 80%\ncharge. This means that the more your battery remains in this range, the\nlonger your battery’s useful life is likely to be. The best way to ensure you\nonly charge over 80% when necessary is to set your charge limit to 80%. You\ncan stay above 20% by planning ahead as much as possible and charging above\n20% when you have the opportunity to do so.\n\n### AC Charging\n\nAlternating current (AC) charging is the best way to ensure long-term battery\nhealth. For Lucid Air, AC charging occurs at a maximum of 19.2 kW, which\nreduces stress on your vehicle’s battery cells. By comparison, DC charging can\ndeliver as much as 350 kW to your vehicle. This is much faster, but the extra\npower can stress your battery cells and degrade them over time. When your\nschedule allows you to do so, opt for AC charging.\n\n### DC Charging Derating\n\nIf you use DC charging a lot, your Lucid Air may pre-emptively lower how many\nkilowatts your vehicle is charging at to help preserve long-term battery\nhealth. For example, if you are at a DC fast charging station that is capable\nof charging at 300 kW, your Lucid Air might only charge at 100 kW because your\nbattery has automatically adjusted how many kilowatts it will accept.  \n  \nTo optimize the speed of your fast charging sessions:  \n  \n\\- Consider using AC charging for all your day-to-day charging needs by\nplugging in at home or at work.  \n  \n\\- Precondition your battery before DC fast charging. You can do this by\ntapping Start Preconditioning on the Charging screen before charging or by\nusing Lucid’s Navigation app to route to a nearby fast charging station when\nSmart Preconditioning is enabled.  \n  \n\\- Wait until your battery is low (around 20%) to use DC fast charging. If\nyour battery is at 70% and your charge limit is 80%, consider waiting to\ncharge or using AC charging instead.\n\n### Always Plugging In\n\nEnvironmental factors, including temperature, can affect battery longevity and\nperformance. If you live somewhere with temperature extremes or large\ntemperature swings, this can put stress on your battery.  \n  \nOne way to reduce the impact of temperature changes on your battery is to make\nsure your vehicle is always plugged in to an AC charging cable, even if you\naren’t charging. Your battery system has built-in temperature controls, so\nhaving an external power source provides additional energy to maintain an\noptimal temperature without affecting range. It also has the added benefit of\nallowing you to use Remote Climate features without affecting your range.\n\n## Lucid Air Charging Tips\n\n1\\. Even if you don’t need to recharge your battery, try to plug in whenever\nyou can. This is because your vehicle can more easily regulate your battery’s\ntemperature using an external power source, ensuring your battery health\nremains higher, longer.\n\n2\\. Use the Charge Limit slider on the Charging screen to set your charge\nlimit to Daily, or anywhere between 50% and 80%. This ensures you have enough\ncharge to get everywhere you need to go while maintaining optimal battery\nhealth. You can set the Charge Limit slider to Distance before a long trip for\nmaximum range.\n\n3\\. Precondition your battery before fast charging, either by tapping Start\nPreconditioning on the Charging screen or using Smart Preconditioning and the\nNavigation app to route to a fast charging station. Preconditioning ensures\nyour battery is at the best temperature for accepting a charge, so you can\npower up faster and be on your way.\n\n4\\. Take advantage of more economical ways to charge by using Scheduled\nCharging to power up at home during off-peak utility hours.\n\nDiscover everything you need to know about home charging, public charging, and\nour range of innovative charging solutions.\n\nLearn MoreCharging Locations\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### What are charge limits?\n\nFor your Lucid Air, charge limit refers to the maximum battery percentage your\nvehicle will charge to. We recommend setting your charge limit to 80% to\nmaximize battery performance and improve long-term battery health. Read more\nabout charge limits.\n\n### Should I leave my vehicle plugged in when I go away on vacation?\n\nAs a rule of thumb, we recommend plugging your Lucid Air in whenever you\naren’t using it, especially over an extended period of time. Plugging in\nduring periods of inactivity helps power your vehicle’s secondary systems,\nsuch as the system that helps regulate battery temperature, without using the\nenergy stored in your battery. This can help preserve battery pack life for\nlonger and ensure you’re getting the most use out of your battery. The\nelements can also impact your battery. If you’re leaving your vehicle for an\nextended period of time, we recommend parking it in a covered location.\n\n### How often should I charge my Lucid Air?\n\nLucid recommends plugging in your vehicle whenever you aren’t using it. If\nyour charge limit is set to 80%, this means that your vehicle will charge most\ntimes you plug in, but not always. AC charging is best for your battery, and\nif you use DC charging regularly, a mixture of AC and DC charging can prevent\nDC charging derating. If you can’t plug in every day, ensuring that you charge\na few times per week, mixing AC and DC charging, and maintaining your battery\nabove 20% are ways to promote long-term battery health and ensure you have\nenough charge to get where you want to go.\n\n### My charge port lights are flashing. What should I do?\n\nFirst, check what the charge port lights mean here. Next, if the lights are\nred, check whether you have a notification on the Glass Cockpit or in the\nLucid mobile app. Unplugging and plugging in again helps resolve most charging\nerrors you might encounter. Finally, if you have plugged in again and the\nproblem is persisting, you can reach out to Customer Care for assistance.\n\n### Is the EPA range on the Lucid Motors website the actual range my car will\nget?\n\nThe EPA (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency) estimated range is the\nestimated number of miles a vehicle can travel on a single, full charge (both\nhighway and city). The EPA testing process is especially rigorous and is\nconducted in a laboratory under controlled conditions. This means that\ndepending on where and how you drive, as well as your vehicle's equipment and\naccessory usage, your range may vary. Please consult your Owner's Manual for\nmore information about factors and conditions that impact your vehicle's\ndriving range.\n\n### The Glass Cockpit says my battery went down by more miles than I drove.\nWhy is that?\n\nYour vehicle’s battery doesn’t just power your electric motors, it also powers\nyour infotainment system, climate controls, and more. This means, for example,\nthat on a very cold day, your vehicle may lose some range because the battery\nis cold, then lose additional range because you’re using energy to heat the\ncabin. The number of miles shown on the Glass Cockpit is always just an\nestimate and can change based on how and where you’re driving. Your vehicle\nalso has a powerful regenerative braking feature that captures your vehicle’s\nkinetic energy and transfers it back into your battery. This means that if you\nare driving in a way that optimizes regenerative braking or if you’re driving\nfrom a mountain summit to the valley floor (downhill most of the way), you\nmight travel much farther than the miles on the Glass Cockpit would suggest.\n\n### My battery is at 0%. What should I do?\n\nTo help you feel confident about your range, whether you’re driving or parked,\nyour vehicle makes it easy to check your battery level and keeps you informed\nif it starts getting low. If your battery starts getting too low, you’ll see\nwarnings on the Glass Cockpit, and you can enable push notifications on your\nphone that will let you know you should charge soon. If your battery is\ncritically low, these notifications will warn you to charge immediately. It’s\nimportant to pay attention to these warnings to avoid a situation where your\nbattery reaches 0%.\n\nIf your battery does reach 0%, we’re here for you. If you need immediate\nassistance or help transporting your vehicle somewhere you can charge, contact\nCustomer Care or Lucid Roadside Assistance 24/7. If you plug in and your\nvehicle doesn’t start charging right away, check that the station is working\nand that the charging connector is fully inserted into the charge port. If you\nare at a DC fast charging station, check the Lucid mobile app for\ncompatibility. If you verify your connection and compatibility and you are\nstill having issues, contact Customer Care for assistance.\n\nTo keep your battery from reaching 0% while your vehicle is parked, for\nexample while you’re on vacation, make sure your charge limit is set to Daily\nand that your vehicle is plugged in and charging before you leave. You can\nmonitor your battery level with the Lucid mobile app from almost anywhere, so\nyou can resolve any issues before your battery reaches 0%.\n\n### Can I use the same adapter for both AC and DC charging?\n\nNo, you need two separate NACS-to-CCS adapters, one for AC charging (NACS-\nto-J1772) and one for DC charging (NACS-to-CCS) at NACS stations. This is\nbecause AC and DC charging require different types of connectors and energy\ndelivery mechanisms. An adapter designed for AC charging will not be\ncompatible with DC charging and vice versa. You can purchase Lucid-approved\nadapters from the Lucid Store.\n\n### Why is my Lucid Charging Service public charging session not starting?\n\nIf you are having trouble getting your charging session to start, use the\nsteps below for potential solutions. Before you start, make sure:\n\n  * You have the Lucid mobile app, are signed in, and your vehicle is connected to your account.\n\n  * You are enrolled in the Lucid Charging Service.\n\n  * You have added a valid payment method to your account.\n\nHere are some steps to try to resolve your charging session issue and start\ncharging your vehicle:\n\n  * Unplug your vehicle from the charging station, wait for at least one full minute to allow the station to reset.\n\n  * Check the charging connector and charge port for any debris or damage that might prevent the components from making contact. Remove any debris. If you see any damage, schedule service.\n\n  * Firmly insert the connector into the charge port and try your session again.\n\nCheck for any error messages on the charging station and switch stations if\nnecessary. If the session still doesn’t start, contact Customer Care for\nassistance.\n\n### I received a notification about a Lucid Charging Service payment issue.\nWhat does that mean?\n\nIf you received a payment issue notification or email, your Lucid Charging\nService account has been placed on hold. You will not be able to pay for\nfuture charging sessions until you resolve the payment issue. Reasons you may\nhave received this notification include your default payment method expiring,\nbeing canceled or over a set limit, or being suspended.\n\nTo manage your payment methods, go to the Owner’s Portal. If you need to\nupdate your default payment method, you can do so in your Lucid Wallet in the\nLucid mobile app. In the meantime, if you are at a charging station and need\nto charge, you can do so by paying directly at the station, if available.\n\n### What happened to complimentary charging at Electrify America?\n\nAs of January 1, 2025, Lucid stopped offering complimentary charging at\nElectrify America fast charging stations for new Lucid owners enrolled in the\nLucid Charging Service. Lucid owners can still charge at Electrify America\nchargers through the Lucid Charging Service and will have access to Plug &\nCharge. Owners with complimentary charging may continue to use it until their\noffer expires.\n\n## Looking for something else?\n\nTell us in a few words.\n\n## Contact us\n\nWe’re here to help.\n\nContact\n\n### Lucid Air\n\nExplore Lucid Air\n\nCompare Vehicles\n\nPure\n\nTouring\n\nGrand Touring\n\nSapphire\n\nFleet\n\nDesign Yours\n\nAvailable Vehicles\n\nDemo Drive\n\n### Lucid Gravity\n\nExplore Lucid Gravity\n\nCompare Vehicles\n\nRoad to Lucid Gravity Videos\n\nDesign Yours\n\nAvailable Vehicles\n\nLucid Gravity Essentials\n\nStay Informed\n\nDemo Drive\n\n### Lucid Motors\n\nCompany\n\nLeadership\n\nBoard of Directors\n\nCareers\n\nLucid × Timothée Chalamet\n\nStories\n\nTech Talks\n\nInvestors\n\nSustainability\n\nLucid Technologies\n\n### More\n\nOwnership\n\nReferral Program\n\nAccessories\n\nContact Us\n\nLocations\n\nEvents\n\nMedia Room\n\nAwards and Accolades\n\nDisconnect Remote Vehicle Access\n\nKnowledge Center\n\n©2025 Lucid.

Referrers who engage in spamming or other unfair or otherwise\nproblematic practices, including creating fake accounts or harassing potential\nreferral sources will be deemed ineligible to participate in the Program.\n\nHow It Works\n\nTo participate, you simply share the unique referral code generated for you\nand available in your Owner’s Portal. You may share your link or QR code with\nfriends and family. Lucid owners may only redeem points for up to 4 Referred\nCustomers per calendar year. The limit will be reached when there are 4\nconfirmed orders using one referral link. Only one Referrer can be associated\nwith a Referred Customer and Lucid will credit the first Referrer. If you are\nthe first Referrer associated with that customer and that customer is a first-\ntime customer who does not have an existing order, you will be considered a\nReferrer for that Referred Customer. If your referred customer places an order\nfor and takes delivery of a Lucid vehicle, you will receive either reward\npoints (“Points”) or a specific reward, depending on the vehicle your Referred\nCustomer purchases. The number of Points or reward you receive for each\nReferred Customer depends upon the Lucid vehicle they purchase using your\nreferral link, as shown in the table below. Referrers may redeem their Points\nfor items and/or experiences that match their value as indicated in the Lucid\nRewards Store. Points values listed for items and experiences in the Lucid\nRewards Store are exclusive of sales tax.\n\nPoints are only for designated Lucid products and experiences available in the\nLucid Rewards Store and may never be redeemed for cash or products and\nservices in the Lucid Store (store.lucidmotors.com). Points are non-\ntransferrable, non-assignable, and cannot be bequeathed to anyone else in the\nevent of death. Any product or experience redeemed by a Referrer is a final\ntransaction, and such product or experience cannot be returned for a refund or\nexchanged. Referrer is responsible for all taxes associated with points\naccrual and redemption. Referrer is responsible for all taxes associated with\npoints accrual and redemption. A W-9 will need to be completed by the\nReferrer. To the extent permitted by applicable law, if the Referrer does not\ncomplete a Form W-9 within 60 days of such request, Lucid reserves the right\nto rescind referrer’s points.\n\nPoints will generally be awarded within 60 days of delivery of the Referred\nCustomer’s vehicle. Lucid may withhold or invalidate any Points garnered in\nways that it deems fraudulent, suspect, or in violation of these Terms. A\nReferrer’s points will expire two (2) years after they are issued or earlier\nif this program is terminated. All of Lucid’s decisions are final and binding,\nexcept where prohibited, including when and if to terminate the Program, and\nwhether, if at all, to change the Program. Any changes to the Program will be\ncommunicated to Referrers in any manner Lucid so chooses to Referrers and,\nexcept where prohibited, will become effective as of the date the\ncommunication is sent or published. If a Referrer has referrals pending at the\ntime that updates are sent, those pending referrals shall be evaluated under\nthe terms that were valid at the time the Referred Customer placed their\norder.\n\nReferred Customers will also be eligible for cash discounts on their referred\npurchase, as indicated in the table below.\n\nVehicle purchased or leased by referred customer\n\nReferrer points earned\n\nDiscount available to referred customer\n\nLucid Air Pure\n\n4,000 points\n\n$500 discount on Vehicle Purchase or Lease\n\nLucid Air Touring\n\n4,000 points\n\n$1,000 discount on Vehicle Purchase or Lease\n\nLucid Air Grand Touring\n\n4,000 points\n\n$1,250 discount on Vehicle Purchase or Lease\n\nLucid Air Sapphire\n\nNot eligible\n\nNot eligible\n\nLucid Gravity Grand Touring\n\nNot eligible\n\nNot eligible\n\n*Points and discounts only available for the purchase or lease of a new Lucid vehicle.

It outlines the initial\nsteps in our sustainability mission to improve our impact on the planet and\nsociety in the years ahead.\n\nDownload\n\n## The Lucid Air produces less greenhouse gas emissions than comparable EVs in\nthe market today.\n\nThe Lucid Air is the most energy-efficient electric sedan in the U.S. market\ntoday. The 2025 Lucid Air Grand Touring produces about 6% fewer greenhouse gas\nemissions during use than the leading U.S. EV competitor, and about 30% less\nemissions than the leading German EV competitor.¹\n\n## Greater Efficiency for the Greater Good\n\nFor Lucid, efficiency means using less materials and energy to do more, while\nbeing intentional about our use of the planet’s resources. Our commitment to\nefficiency has created one of the fastest-charging, longest range, and most\nefficient EVs. By using fewer batteries and less grid electricity, we’ve\nreduced the demand for critical materials and their environmental impact.\n\n## EV change is here\n\nWe are committed to inspiring the adoption of sustainable energy through our\nadvanced technologies. Our technological innovations are revolutionizing\nelectric mobility and building the foundations for a zero-emissions future.\n\n## Our people make a world of difference\n\nWe believe supporting our employees and communities is key to a more\nsustainable future. At Lucid, we’re fostering a culture and mindset of\nsustainability that amplifies our impact well beyond the walls of our\norganization.\n\n## United Nations Global Compact\n\nLucid is a proud participant of the United Nations Global Compact (UN Global\nCompact), the world’s largest voluntary corporate sustainability initiative.\nThe UN Global Compact challenges companies to conduct business responsibly by\naligning their operations and strategies with the UN’s Ten Principles which\npertain to human rights, labor, environmental practices, and anti-corruption.\nIt also commits companies to take actions in accordance with the UN\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These goals provide a powerful\naspiration for businesses, governments, civil society, and citizens to make a\nbetter world.\n\nDriving the World Forward\n\n## By staying true to our values and taking responsibility for our impact, we\ncompromise nothing to go further for people and the planet.\n\n## Stay up to Speed on the latest at Lucid.\n\nEmail\n\n### Lucid Air\n\nExplore Lucid Air\n\nCompare Vehicles\n\nPure\n\nTouring\n\nGrand Touring\n\nSapphire\n\nFleet\n\nDesign Yours\n\nAvailable Vehicles\n\nDemo Drive\n\n### Lucid Gravity\n\nExplore Lucid Gravity\n\nCompare Vehicles\n\nRoad to Lucid Gravity Videos\n\nDesign Yours\n\nAvailable Vehicles\n\nLucid Gravity Essentials\n\nStay Informed\n\nDemo Drive\n\n### Lucid Motors\n\nCompany\n\nLeadership\n\nBoard of Directors\n\nCareers\n\nLucid × Timothée Chalamet\n\nStories\n\nTech Talks\n\nInvestors\n\nSustainability\n\nLucid Technologies\n\n### More\n\nOwnership\n\nReferral Program\n\nAccessories\n\nContact Us\n\nLocations\n\nEvents\n\nMedia Room\n\nAwards and Accolades\n\nDisconnect Remote Vehicle Access\n\nKnowledge Center\n\n©2025 Lucid.

(“us” or “we” or “Lucid”). We want to improve\nroad safety through the use and further development of driver assistance\nsystems. Our aim is to reduce the number of road accidents, in particular road\nfatalities, by incorporating and improving driver assistance systems.\n\nFor this purpose, we are currently operating a fleet of Lucid vehicles on the\nroad in the European Union for testing purposes, identified by a logo (see\nbelow), and which record data from various sensors, including video and audio\nrecordings of the vehicle environment. This privacy statement describes the\nnature and use of personal data that may be recorded of the surroundings of\nthe car by driver assistance systems for these testing purposes.\n\nThis privacy statement does not apply to vehicle data collected during the\noperation of a vehicle outside of the testing environment. For information\nregarding the collection of vehicle data such as Vehicle Health, User Vehicle\nInteractions or Status Data, please visit our Lucid Motors Vehicle Data\nPrivacy Policy for additional information.\n\nThis privacy statement also does not apply to the collection of data when you\nuse a Lucid website or app, or in relation to your ordering, financing or\ntaking delivery of a Lucid vehicle. For further information regarding the\ncollection of such data, visit one of our stores or service centers, or\ncontact us directly by email or by phone. Please visit our Privacy Policy for\nadditional information.\n\nHow do I recognize the Lucid test vehicles?\n\nThe Lucid test vehicles are identified by this logo.\n\nWho is the data controller responsible for the data processing?\n\nWe are the controller within the meaning of the EU General Data Protection\nRegulation (“GDPR”) for the processing of personal data related to video and\naudio recordings collected by the Lucid test vehicles.\n\nWhat data do we process from you and for what purpose?\n\nThe personal data collected through the use of Lucid test vehicles on public\nroads are processed as follows:\n\nLucid vehicles are equipped with various sensors (such as radar, ultrasonic,\nGPS/location sensors), interior microphones and video cameras. Public road\ntraffic (environment of the Lucid vehicle) is recorded on data, video and\naudio files, and stored and processed for further analysis, and combined with\nother sensor data if necessary.\n\nThe video recordings are used to create static and dynamic traffic objects _._\nThese can be road markings, cars, motorbikes, bicycles, etc. with their\nindividual position and movement in relation to the Lucid vehicle as well as\nthe position and movement of pedestrians. To calculate the possible movement\nof a pedestrian - e.g. whether a person intends to cross a road - their line\nof sight can also be analysed.\n\nThe video and sensor data are used while driving to recognize road users and\nbasic traffic scenarios and act accordingly. In a further evaluation of the\nrecordings, the video and sensor data are used to develop and improve the\ndriver assistance systems.\n\nWe are not interested in identifying a person and our systems are not\nconfigured for such purposes, as this is not necessary for the use and further\ndevelopment of the driver assistance systems. All traffic objects are only\ncategorised as cars, motorbikes, pedestrians, etc. Nevertheless, the video\nrecordings may include recordings of individuals in traffic, car registration\nnumbers or other personal data.\n\nWhat is the legal basis for this data processing?\n\nThe legal basis for collecting and processing the video recordings of the\nsurroundings of the Lucid vehicle (including the recordings of personal data\nof pedestrians and drivers) is based on the legitimate interests pursued by\nthe controller according to Sec. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR.\n\nLucid has a legitimate interest in the further development of driver\nassistance systems. The data collected by the Lucid vehicles will be used to\nimprove and develop algorithms for various functions of the driver assistance\nsystems.__ This can also serve the public interest. Video recording of the\nsurroundings of Lucid vehicles is necessary to improve the road safety of\nthese vehicles.\n\nThe processing and storage of the collected data is furthermore particularly\nimportant for protection in the event of legal proceedings or to comply with\nlegal obligations, in particular the requirements of the supervisory\nauthorities.\n\nHow long do we store your data?\n\nWe exclusively store your personal data for as long as the respective purpose\nof processing requires. If data is processed for more than one purpose, the\ndata will be deleted or will only continue to be stored in a form that cannot\nbe directly traced back to you as soon as the last stated purpose of\nprocessing has been fulfilled.\n\nHow is your data secured?\n\nWe secure your data according to the state of the art. Access to personal data\nis restricted to a limited number of authorised persons for the stated\npurposes. The following security measures are used as examples to protect your\npersonal data from misuse or other unauthorised processing:\n\n  * Collected data is only transmitted in encrypted form.\n\n  * The IT systems used to process the data are technically isolated from other systems to prevent unauthorised access, e.g. through hacking.\n\n  * In addition, access to these IT systems is permanently monitored in order to detect and prevent misuse at an early stage.\n\nWho do we share data with and how do we protect you in the process?\n\nWe share the data with other affiliated companies, in particular with Lucid\nGroup, Inc.\n\nWhen data is processed in countries outside the European Union (EU), Lucid\nuses EU standard contractual clauses to ensure that your personal data is\nprocessed in accordance with European data protection standards. If you would\nlike to view the specific safeguards for transferring data to other countries,\nplease contact us through one of the communication channels listed below.\n\nB. Contact details, your data subject rights and your right to complain to a\nsupervisory authority\n\nIf you have any questions regarding the use of your personal data, we\nrecommend that you contact Lucid Privacy by sending a message to the following\ne-mail address: Privacy@Lucidmotors.com\n\nYou can also contact the responsible data protection officer:\n\nJoke Bodewits joke.bodewits@​hoganlovells.com Atrium - North Tower\nStrawinskylaan 4129 Amsterdam 1077 ZX The Netherlands\n\nC. Data subject rights\n\nAs a data subject affected by the processing of your data, you can assert\ncertain rights with us under the GDPR as well as under other relevant data\nprotection provisions.\n\nIn certain situations, we may not be able to provide you with information on\nall collected data due to legal requirements or the information available to\nus. In such cases, we cannot retrieve the recorded person’s data without\nadditional information. If the recorded persons cannot be identified without\nadditional information and because such recognition is not necessary for the\nprocessing purpose pursued at Lucid, we are not allowed by law to carry out\nany additional data processing for identification purposes; in such cases,\nyour rights under Sec.15 to 20 GDPR might be excluded. Your data subject\nrights are only applicable if you provide us with additional information that\nallows us to uniquely identify you. Even with this additional information, we\nmight not be able to verify your right to access or erase the data because we\ndo not identify individuals on the video and audio recordings and therefore do\nnot know who the data subjects on the recordings are. Your data subject rights\nare limited by the rights of others or by the need to retain the data for\nother legal reasons.\n\nAccording to the GDPR, you as a data subject are in particular entitled to the\nfollowing rights against Lucid:\n\nRight of Access (Sec. 15 GDPR):\n\nYou can request information from us at any time about the data we hold about\nyou. This information concerns, among other things, the categories of data we\nprocess, the purposes for which we process them, the origin of the data if we\nhave not collected it directly from you and, if applicable, the recipients to\nwhom we have transmitted your data. You can obtain a copy of your data from us\nfree of charge. Should you be interested in further copies, we reserve the\nright to charge you for the further copies.\n\nRight to rectification (Sec. 16 GDPR):\n\nYou can ask us to rectify your data. We will take reasonable steps to keep the\ndata we hold about you and process on an ongoing basis accurate, complete and\nup to date based on the most recent information available to us.\n\nRight to erasure (Sec. 17 GDPR):\n\nYou can demand that we delete your data if the legal requirements for this are\nmet. According to Sec. 17 GDPR, this may be the case if:\n\n  * the data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed;\n\n  * you withdraw your consent, which is the basis for the data processing, and there is no other legal basis for the processing;\n\n  * you object to the processing of your data and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or you object to the processing of data for direct marketing purposes;\n\n  * the data has been processed unlawfully unless the processing is necessary to ensure compliance with a legal obligation requiring us to process your data;\n\n  * in particular with regard to legal retention periods;\n\n  * to assert, exercise or defend legal claims.\n\nRight to restriction of processing (Sec. 18 GDPR):\n\nYou can ask us to restrict the processing of your data if:\n\n  * you dispute the accuracy of the data for the period of time we need to verify the accuracy of the data;\n\n  * the processing is unlawful and you object to the erasure of your data and request the restriction of its use instead;\n\n  * we no longer need your data but you need it to assert, exercise or defend legal claims;\n\n  * you have objected to the processing as long as it has not yet been determined whether our legitimate grounds outweigh yours.\n\nRight to data portability (Sec. 20 GDPR):\n\nAt your request, we will transfer your data - insofar as this is technically\npossible - to another controller. However, you only have this right if the\ndata processing is based on your consent or is necessary to perform a\ncontract. Instead of receiving a copy of your data, you can also ask us to\ntransfer the data directly to another controller specified by you.\n\nRight to object (Sec. 21 GDPR):\n\nYou may object to the processing of your data at any time for reasons arising\nfrom your particular situation, provided that the data processing is based on\nyour consent or on our legitimate interests or those of a third party. In this\ncase, we will no longer process your data. The latter does not apply if we can\ndemonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override\nyour interests or we need your data to assert, exercise or defend legal\nclaims.\n\nD. Deadlines for the fulfilment of data subject rights\n\nWe generally aim to comply with all requests within 30 days. However, this\nperiod may be extended for reasons relating to the specific data subject right\nor the complexity of your request.\n\nE. Complaint to supervisory authorities\n\nLucid takes your concerns and rights very seriously. However, if you feel that\nwe have not adequately addressed your complaints or concerns, you have the\nright to lodge a complaint with a competent data protection authority.\n\nThe competent data protection authority for us is the Dutch supervisory\nauthority Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens, PO Box 93374, 2509 AJ DEN HAAG.\n\n## Website and Mobile App\n\n### Terms of Use\n\nLast update: July 2024\n\nWelcome to our website.

By providing us with a Submission, you hereby: (i)\ngrant to Lucid a world-wide, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable, sub-\nlicensable, royalty-free, non-exclusive, and unrestricted license to copy,\nreproduce, adapt, transmit, edit, modify, or otherwise use, publicly display,\ndistribute, translate and create compilations and derivative works from, any\nand all Submissions (in any format or media) that you post on, upload or\notherwise submit to or through, the website; and (ii) waive all moral rights\nin and to all Submissions that you post on, upload or otherwise submit to or\nthrough, the website in favor of Lucid.

However, either party may bring claims in small claims\ncourt if they meet the necessary criteria. Arbitration does not involve a\njudge or jury, and the court’s review of arbitration awards is limited.\nNevertheless, an arbitrator may award the same damages and relief as a court\non an individual basis, including injunctive, declaratory relief, or statutory\ndamages.\n\nThe term “Disputes” encompasses the following: (1) Any dispute or claim\nbetween you and Lucid Entities; (2) Any dispute or claim arising from or\nrelated to your use of the website, or any resulting transactions or\nrelationships (including with nonsignatory third parties). “Lucid Entities”\ninclude Lucid Group USA, Inc.; Lucid USA, Inc.; Lucid Motors Canada ULC; their\nparents, subsidiaries, predecessors, successors, assignees, officers,\nemployees, representatives, agents, affiliates, and authorized service and\nrepair facilities.\n\nDisputes concerning the validity, application, scope, enforceability, or\ninterpretation of this Website Terms Arbitration Agreement will be exclusively\ndecided by the arbitrator. The Website Terms Arbitration Agreement and\nassociated proceedings, such as waiver or estoppel before, during, or after\narbitration, will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C § 1 et\nseq., and federal common law, not by any state laws or procedures regarding\narbitration. The arbitrator holds the exclusive authority to address\nchallenges to this Website Terms Arbitration Agreement, including questions of\nwaiver, estoppel, breach, or the validity of any part of this Website Terms\nArbitration Agreement.\n\nBefore initiating any dispute or claim through arbitration or otherwise, you\nand we must engage in an informal telephonic dispute resolution conference\n(“Conference”). If you are a natural person, you must participate in the\nConference, while non-natural-person parties must designate a representative.\n\nTo initiate a Conference, one party must provide written notice to the other\nparty, including the initiating party’s name, contact information, a\ndescription of the dispute, the requested amount for resolution, and the\npersonal signature of any natural-person party (a copy may be submitted via\nemail). The notice can be sent to us at disputes@lucidmotors.com. The\nConference should occur within 60 days after the other party receives the\nnotice, and during this process, any statute of limitations or filing\ndeadlines will be suspended. An initiating party’s failure to participate in\nthis process will result in the arbitrator dismissing that party’s arbitration\ndemand.\n\nFor certain warranty disputes, you may opt to use the BBB AUTO LINE procedure\noutlined in your Vehicle’s limited warranty. All unresolved Disputes remain\nsubject to this Website Terms Arbitration Agreement.\n\nThe arbitration will be conducted by New Era ADR (www.neweraadr.com) or the\nAmerican Arbitration Association (“AAA”) (www.adr.org). Unless modified by\nthis Arbitration Agreement, New Era ADR’s arbitration will follow its Virtual\nExpedited Arbitration Rules and Procedures (www.neweraadr.com/rules-and-\nprocedures/), while AAA’s arbitration will adhere to AAA’s Consumer\nArbitration Rules (www.adr.org). A neutral arbitrator must be appointed, and\nboth parties will be responsible for their respective initial filing fees to\ninitiate arbitration. Subsequently, each party will cover their filing,\nadministration, service or case management fees, as well as the arbitrator or\nhearing fees, up to a maximum of $5,000, unless the law or the rules of the\nchosen arbitration organization require us to pay more.\n\nYou and we may only bring disputes against each other on an individual basis\nand not as part of a class, collective, consolidated, or representative\naction. However, both parties may file a court suit to: enjoin intellectual\nproperty rights infringement, file for bankruptcy, enforce a security interest\nin the Vehicle through repossession, enforce the arbitrator’s decision, or\nrequest a court review if the arbitrator exceeded their authority.\n\nDiscovery procedures as outlined in the New Era ADR or AAA rules should\nsuffice for most claims. If there is a dispute over the scope of discovery, it\nshould include the right for either side to inspect the Vehicle and exchange\nrelevant Vehicle-related documents.\n\nUnless the governing law requires a specific statute of limitations for a\nparticular arbitration claim, any claim related to a Dispute must be filed no\nlater than three (3) years after the claim or cause of action arose, or it\nwill be forever barred.\n\nIf any part of this Website Terms Arbitration Agreement is unenforceable, it\nwill be severed, and the remaining portions will be enforced. However, if the\nclass-action waiver is deemed unenforceable in a Dispute involving class\nallegations, the entire Website Terms Arbitration Agreement will be\nunenforceable for that Dispute.\n\nIn cases where multiple claims or remedies are asserted in one proceeding, and\nnot all of them are subject to arbitration, the non-arbitrable claims or\nremedies must be stayed until all arbitrable claims or remedies have been\nresolved. If one party files a court action, the other party may seek to\ncompel arbitration, and all proceedings will be stayed until the full\nresolution of the proceedings to compel arbitration, including any related\nappeals.\n\nOpt-Out: You have the option to opt-out of this Website Terms Arbitration\nAgreement within 30 days from the date of placing your Order. To do so, send\nan email to Optout@LucidMotors.com from the email associated with your order,\nwith “Website Terms Arbitration Opt-Out” in the subject line and a request to\nopt-out of this Website Terms Arbitration Agreement in the email’s body.\nOpting out only applies to this Website Terms Arbitration Agreement and will\nnot affect the validity or enforceability of any other arbitration agreements.\n\nTermination\n\nIf you breach any provision of these Terms of Use you may no longer use the\nwebsite.

As such, the security of our systems, applications, and\ndata is paramount. If you are a security researcher and have discovered a\nsecurity vulnerability in one of our services, we appreciate your help in\ndisclosing it to us in a responsible manner.\n\n### Vulnerability Disclosure Guidelines\n\nWe will investigate legitimate reports and make every effort to quickly\ncorrect any vulnerability. To encourage responsible reporting, we will not\ntake legal action nor ask law enforcement to investigate you, provided you\ncomply with the following Vulnerability Disclosure Guidelines:\n\n  * Engage in this program in good faith and in compliance with all applicable laws\n\n  * Provide details of the vulnerability, including the methodology and any other information needed to reproduce and validate the vulnerability. Where possible, provide a Proof of Concept (POC).\n\n  * Confirm you are not a on the Specially Designated Nationals List or a resident of a country sanctioned by the United States government\n\nYou further agree that by participating in this program, you will not:\n\n  * Publicly disclose any vulnerability identified and reported to Lucid Motors through this program before Lucid Motors completes remediation of the issue\n\n  * Compromise or disclose any confidential or proprietary information belonging to Lucid Motors or related entities\n\n  * Access or disclose any employee, customer, vehicle operator or other individual’s personal information that is not your own\n\n  * Conduct any vulnerability testing or activities that could harm or put at risk of harm Lucid Motors, its employees, its customers, or any other individuals, including denial-of-service, social engineering, phishing, etc.\n\n  * Conduct any vulnerability testing or activities that could compromise or impact any vehicle that you do not own\n\n  * Test the physical security of any Lucid Motors property or the property of any other individual that has not given you express consent\n\n### Ratings\n\n _For the initial prioritization/rating of findings, this program will use\nthe_ __Bugcrowd Vulnerability Rating Taxonomy__ _. However, it is important to\nnote that in some cases a vulnerability priority will be modified due to its\nlikelihood or impact. In any instance where an issue is downgraded, a full,\ndetailed explanation will be provided to the researcher - along with the\nopportunity to appeal and make a case for a higher priority._\n\n###  Scope\n\n _In-Scope_\n\nIn principle, any Lucid-owned web service that handles reasonably sensitive\nuser data is intended to be in scope. This includes virtually all the content\nin the following domain - lucidmotors.com. Anything not defined here is out-\nof-scope of this program.\n\n_Qualifying vulnerabilities_ Any design or implementation issue that\nsubstantially affects the confidentiality or integrity of user data or\nfunctionalities of Lucid-owned web service is likely to be in scope for the\nprogram. Common examples include:\n\n  * Cross-site scripting,\n\n  * Cross-site request forgery,\n\n  * Mixed-content scripts,\n\n  * Authentication or authorization flaws,\n\n  * Server-side code execution bugs.\n\n_Non-qualifying vulnerabilities_ The following issues are outside the scope of\nour Vulnerability Disclosure Program (either ineligible or false positives):\n\n  * Lucid Motors manufacturing environment\n\n  * Lucid Motors MFA issues\n\n  * WAF bypass\n\n  * Open redirects / Lack of security speedbump when leaving the site\n\n  * Internal IP address disclosure\n\n  * Accessible Non-sensitive files and directories (e.g. README.TXT, CHANGES.TXT, robots.txt, .gitignore, etc.)\n\n  * Social engineering / phishing attacks\n\n  * Self XSS\n\n  * Text injection\n\n  * Email spoofing (including SPF, DKIM, DMARC, From: spoofing, and visually similar, and related issues)\n\n  * Descriptive error messages (e.g., stack traces, application or server errors, path disclosure)\n\n  * Fingerprinting/banner disclosure on common/public services\n\n  * Clickjacking and issues only exploitable through clickjacking\n\n  * CSRF issues that don’t impact the integrity of an account (e.g., log in or out, contact forms and other publicly accessible forms)\n\n  * Lack of Secure and HTTPOnly cookie flags (critical systems may still be in scope)\n\n  * Lack of rate limiting\n\n  * Login or Forgot Password page brute force, account lockout not enforced, or insufficient password strength requirements\n\n  * HTTPS mixed content scripts\n\n  * Username / email enumeration by brute forcing / error messages (e.g., login / signup / forgotten password)\n\n  * Exceptional cases may still be in scope (e.g., ability to enumerate email addresses via incrementing a numeric parameter)\n\n  * Missing HTTP security headers\n\n  * TLS/SSL Issues, including BEAST BREACH, insecure renegotiation, bad cipher suite, expired certificates, etc.\n\n  * Denial of Service attacks\n\n  * Out-of-date software\n\n  * Use of a known-vulnerable component (exceptional cases, such as where you are able to provide proof of exploitation, may still be in scope)\n\n  * Physical attacks against Lucid Motor’s Facilities / Property\n\n  * Relay or RollJam attacks pertaining to the keyfob, NFC card, and/or phone-as-key\n\nIf you identify an issue that you believe could be a cybersecurity\nvulnerability in any Lucid Motors product or service, please submit your\nreport on our partner profile on Bugcrowd by clicking this link BugCrowd\nVulnerability Disclosure Program.\n\nWe will respond promptly to your report.

At\nLucid, we place an exceptionally high priority on efficiency — our cars must\nmake the best possible use of the world’s resources. So, every Lucid delivers\nexceptional range without sacrificing high performance or sublime comfort.\n\nDiscover\n\n## Leadership\n\nLucid’s leadership team brings to our Silicon Valley headquarters an\nextraordinary depth of knowledge and experience from the automotive and\ntechnology industries. They’re leading us forward to a more sustainable future\nas we use proprietary electric vehicle technology to reinvent the category for\neach type of car we build.\n\nDiscover\n\n## Careers\n\nCome work alongside some of the most accomplished minds in the automotive and\ntechnology industries. Beyond competitive salaries, we are creating a\ncommunity for innovators who want to make a significant — and immediate —\ncontribution to the future of sustainable mobility.\n\nDiscover\n\n## Lucid Motors Factory\n\nAfter evaluating over 60 sites in 13 states for the Lucid Motors factory, we\nchose a 500-acre property in Casa Grande, Arizona. Located between Phoenix and\nTucson — and within easy reach of our Silicon Valley headquarters — the Casa\nGrande offered close proximity to critical utilities, an established\ntransportation system, and strong support from state and local governments.\n\nThis facility is the first greenfield — or purpose-built — EV factory in North\nAmerica. Designed to our exact specifications, it is being built with such\nefficiency and speed that we will complete construction of its first phase a\nmere 12 months after breaking ground.\n\n### Lucid Air\n\nExplore Lucid Air\n\nCompare Vehicles\n\nPure\n\nTouring\n\nGrand Touring\n\nSapphire\n\nFleet\n\nDesign Yours\n\nAvailable Vehicles\n\nDemo Drive\n\n### Lucid Gravity\n\nExplore Lucid Gravity\n\nCompare Vehicles\n\nRoad to Lucid Gravity Videos\n\nDesign Yours\n\nAvailable Vehicles\n\nLucid Gravity Essentials\n\nStay Informed\n\nDemo Drive\n\n### Lucid Motors\n\nCompany\n\nLeadership\n\nBoard of Directors\n\nCareers\n\nLucid × Timothée Chalamet\n\nStories\n\nTech Talks\n\nInvestors\n\nSustainability\n\nLucid Technologies\n\n### More\n\nOwnership\n\nReferral Program\n\nAccessories\n\nContact Us\n\nLocations\n\nEvents\n\nMedia Room\n\nAwards and Accolades\n\nDisconnect Remote Vehicle Access\n\nKnowledge Center\n\n©2025 Lucid.

When you open a WellsTrade IRA, you have the option\nto transfer assets from another IRA, or to roll over assets held with a former\nqualified employer sponsored retirement plan (QRP) such as a 401(k), 403(b) or\ngovernmental 457(b).\n\nPlease keep in mind that rolling over your QRP assets to an IRA is just one\noption. Each option has advantages and disadvantages and the one that is best\ndepends on your individual circumstances. You should consider features such as\ninvestment choices, fees and expenses, and services offered. Investing and\nmaintaining assets in an IRA will generally involve higher costs than those\nassociated with a QRP. We recommend you consult with your current plan\nadministrator and a professional tax advisor before making any decisions\nregarding your retirement assets.\n\n### What are the WellsTrade account fees and commissions?\n\nFor complete information regarding fees and commissions go to WellsTrade\nCommissions and Fees.\n\n### Where can I find specific forms that I need?\n\nMany forms are available at WellsTrade Account Forms.  \n  \nIf you do not see the form you need, you can:\n\n  1. Sign on to your investment account\n  2. Go to **Customer Service** > **Forms**\n  3. Select the appropriate category tab: Account, Money & Securities, IRA, or Tax\n  4. Select the desired form to print and complete\n\nIf you prefer, you can call us at 1-800-TRADERS (1-800-872-3377) and we can\nemail required forms to you.\n\n### More Information\n\n  * Brokerage Client Service Center\n  * Transfer funds online\n  * Margin FAQs\n\n  * New WellsTrade Brokerage accounts\n  * WellsTrade/Brokerage forms\n  * \n\n### Top Questions\n\n### What is an IRA?\n\nAn Individual Retirement Account (IRA) is designed to help you save for\nretirement and take advantage of tax benefits. There are two main types of\nIRAs: Traditional and Roth IRAs.\n\n### What is the difference between a Traditional and Roth IRA?\n\nThe primary difference between a Traditional IRA and Roth IRA is the type of\ntax benefit each offers. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth potential. Investment\nearnings are distributed tax-free, if a five-year waiting period has been met\nand you are at least age 59½, or you are disabled, or using the qualified\nfirst-time homebuyer exception ($10,000 lifetime maximum), or the payment is\nmade to your beneficiary after your death. Since contributions to a Roth IRA\nare made with after-tax dollars, there is no tax deduction regardless of\nincome. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth potential. You pay no taxes\non any investment earnings until you withdraw or “distribute” the money from\nyour account, presumably in retirement. Additionally, depending on your\nincome, your contribution may be tax deductible. Deferring taxes allows for a\npotentially greater accumulation of wealth. For more information about these\nIRAs, including details about eligibility, visit the Traditional vs. Roth\nsection of our IRA Center.\n\n### How do I roll over my QRP to an IRA?\n\nRolling over your QRP to an IRA takes just three steps. Learn how to roll\nover.\n\n### How do I open an IRA?\n\nThe first step in opening an IRA is to select the option that fits your\nindividual investment style. It’s important to know that application\ninstructions vary based on the type of investing style you choose. For\nadditional details on brokerage options, you can also call us at\n1-877-493-4727.\n\n### How do I update my IRA beneficiaries?\n\nYour beneficiary designations generally determine who will inherit your IRA\nand supersede instructions in your will or trust. To update your\nbeneficiaries, have your account number available and call us at the phone\nnumber listed on your IRA statement (to access your statement simply sign on\nto _Wells Fargo Online_ and select **Statements and Documents** in the\n**More** menu).\n\n### More Information\n\n  * IRA FAQs\n  * 401(k) and other employer sponsored retirement plan distribution option FAQs and answers\n\n  * Calculate your IRA potential\n  * 401(k) early withdrawal costs calculator\n  * My Retirement Plan®\n\n## Resources\n\n  * Schedule a consultation \n  * My Retirement Plan® Savings Calculator \n\n## Applications and Rates\n\n  * Apply for an account or service\n  * Save and retrieve applications FAQs\n  * Application status FAQs\n  * Rates\n\n**Investment and Insurance Products are:**\n\n  * **Not Insured by the FDIC or Any Federal Government Agency**\n  * **Not a Deposit or Other Obligation of, or Guaranteed by, the Bank or Any Bank Affiliate**\n  * **Subject to Investment Risks, Including Possible Loss of the Principal Amount Invested**\n\nInvestment products and services are offered through Wells Fargo Advisors.\nWells Fargo Advisors is a trade name used by Wells Fargo Clearing Services,\nLLC (WFCS) and Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network, LLC, Members SIPC,\nseparate registered broker-dealers and non-bank affiliates of Wells Fargo &\nCompany.\n\nWellsTrade® and Intuitive Investor® accounts are offered through WFCS.\n\nFinancial Advisors are registered representatives of WFCS.\n\nPM-09262025-6507571.1.1\n\nLRC-0324\n\n## Still have questions?\n\n### Call Us\n\n**Wells Fargo Advisors Full Service Brokerage**  \n\n**Current Brokerage Customers**  \n1-866-281-7436  \nMon – Fri: 8 am – 12 am  \nEastern Time\n\n**_  \n_**\n\n**WellsTrade ® Online Brokerage  \nExisting WellsTrade Account Questions**  \n1-800-TRADERS (872-3377)  \nMon – Fri: 8 am – 12 am  \nEastern Time\n\n**  \n**\n\n**Current IRA Customers**  \n1-866-281-7436  \nMon – Fri: 8 am – 12 am  \nEastern Time\n\n**  \n**\n\n**New IRAs and Rollovers**  \n1-877-493-4727  \nMon – Fri: 9:00 am – 8:00 pm  \nEastern Time\n\n**  \n**\n\n**Investments  \nExisting Trust and Managed Investment Questions**  \n1-800-352- 3705  \nMon – Fri: 7 am – 9 pm  \nEastern Time\n\n**  \n**\n\n**Wells Fargo Private Bank**  \nLearn more about becoming a client of Wells Fargo Private Bank  \n1-888-715-0380  \nMon – Fri: 9:00 am – 8:00 pm  \nEastern Time\n\nGive Us Feedback\n\n  * Privacy, Cookies, Security & Legal\n  * Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information\n  * Notice of Data Collection\n  * General Terms of Use\n  * Report Fraud\n  * Sitemap\n  * About Wells Fargo\n  * Careers\n  * Inclusion and Accessibility\n  * Home\n\n© 1999 - 2025 Wells Fargo.

Ask a Wells Fargo banker to reactivate your account. Or, you can sign on to Wells Fargo Online® to see if you have the option to reactivate your account online.\n  * Legal or bank restrictions that need to be resolved.\n  * Funds pledged for collateral or other purposes that need to be released.\n  * Balance sweep feature needs to be removed.\n  * Overdrawn accounts that need to be brought to a zero or positive balance.\n  * This information may help you avoid additional transactions and fees: \n    * If your account is enrolled in the optional Debit Card Overdraft Service, any account holder with transaction authority on the eligible checking account can remove the service by visiting a Wells Fargo ATM (select More Choices, Wells Fargo Services), through Online Banking, talking with a branch banker, or calling a phone banker at 1-800-TO-WELLS (1-800-869-3557). Business customers call 1-800-CALL-WELLS (1-800-225-5935).\n    * Review your statements for automatic transactions and cancel them by contacting the merchant(s).\n    * When you have a previously authorized transaction, such as ATM and debit card transactions, account transfers, and Wells Fargo Online Bill Pay transactions presented for payment and your account doesn't have enough money, we will pay the item(s) into overdraft and an overdraft fee may be assessed. Please refer to the Deposit Account Agreement and Consumer Fee and Information Schedule for more information.\n    * When checks and preauthorized automatic payments (ACH) are presented for payment and your account doesn't have enough money, we may pay the item(s) into overdraft or return the item(s) unpaid.

The payee or merchant may charge fees for returned items.   \n\n**How do I close a CD (Time account)?**\n\n  * Call us at 1-800-TO-WELLS (1-800-869-3557)\n  * Visit a Wells Fargo branch near you.\n  * Or complete the Account Closure or Partial Withdrawal Request form (PDF) and send it to us by mail.\n\nPlease note: Early withdrawal penalties may apply if you make withdrawals or\nclose a CD before the maturity date. In addition, the Bank does not pay\ninterest from the maturity date to the date of withdrawal on any funds\nwithdrawn during the grace period. If you make a final transfer or withdrawal,\nyou will have to wait until that item posts.\n\nIf you would like to close your Loan, Line of Credit, or other type of\naccount, please call the appropriate customer service department listed on\nyour statement or in this phone directory.\n\n### How do I search for a check?\n\nIf you already have Wells Fargo Online access, sign on.

A stop payment and reissuance can only be completed\nwithin a branch location. As a condition of stop payment and reissuance, Wells\nFargo Bank will require an indemnity agreement. In addition, for cashier's\nchecks over $1,000.00, the waiting period before the stop payment and\nreissuance of an outstanding cashier's check may be processed is 90 days (30\ndays in the state of Wisconsin and 91 days in the state of New York). The\nwaiting period can be avoided with the purchase of an acceptable surety bond.\nThis can be purchased through Wells Fargo's approved insurance carrier or\nthrough an insurance carrier of the customer's choice. The cost of a surety\nbond varies depending on the amount of the bond and the insurer used. Surety\nbonds are subject to the insurance carrier's underwriting requirements before\nissuance. If the surety bond is not provided, the waiting period applies.\n\nOur overdraft fee for Consumer checking accounts is $35 per item (whether the\noverdraft is by check, ATM withdrawal, debit card transaction, or other\nelectronic means), and we charge no more than three overdraft fees per\nbusiness day. Overdraft fees are not applicable to Clear Access Banking\naccounts.\n\nRecurring debit card payments and other transactions, such as checks, ACH\ntransactions, and other transactions using your account and routing number,\nmay continue to be authorized into overdraft at our discretion if there isn’t\nenough money in the account, even if the account is not enrolled in Debit Card\nOverdraft Service, and our standard overdraft fees and policies will apply.\n\nThe payment of transactions into overdraft is discretionary and we reserve the\nright not to pay. For example, we typically do not pay overdrafts if your\naccount is overdrawn or you have had excessive overdrafts. You must promptly\nbring your account to a positive balance.\n\nMobile deposit is only available through the Wells Fargo Mobile® app on\neligible mobile devices.

reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes described in this\nNotice. Under records and information management policy, we are required to\ndestroy records containing Personal Data, including Sensitive Personal\nInformation, according to specific periods in our retention schedule. However,\nwe may need to hold such records beyond these retention periods as set forth\nin our record retention policy, due to regulatory requirements or in response\nto a regulatory audit, investigation, or other legal matter.\n\n## Requests Under the CCPA\n\nThe CCPA defines a “sale” as the disclosure of Personal Data for monetary or\nother valuable consideration. Wells Fargo does not sell and has not, within\nthe last 12 months, sold Personal Data, including Sensitive Personal\nInformation. Furthermore, we have no actual knowledge that we sell or share\n(for purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising) Personal Data,\nincluding Sensitive Personal Information, of minors under 16 years of age.\n\nIf you are a California resident, you have the right to request that we:\n\n  1. Disclose to you the following information (\"Request to Know\"): \n     1. The categories of Personal Data we collected about you and the categories of sources from which we collected the Personal Data;\n     2. The business or commercial purpose for collecting or sharing Personal Data about you;\n     3. The categories of third parties to whom we disclosed Personal Data about you, and the categories of Personal Data disclosed;\n     4. The categories of Personal Data about you that we shared and the categories of third parties with whom we shared such Personal Data; and\n     5. The specific pieces of Personal Data we collected about you.\n  2. Delete Personal Data we collected from you (\"Request to Delete\").\n  3. Correct inaccurate personal information that we maintain about you (\"Request to Correct\").\n  4. Opt you out of \"sharing\", for purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising, (\"Request to Opt-Out of Sharing\").\n\nIn addition, you have the right to be free from discrimination by a business\nfor exercising your CCPA privacy rights, including the right as an employee,\napplicant, or independent contractor not to be retaliated against for\nexercising your CCPA privacy rights.\n\nView Wells Fargo's CCPA record-keeping details in the annual disclosure.\n\n## How to Make Requests\n\nIf you are a California resident, you can make a Request to Know, Delete, or\nCorrect by:\n\n  1. Contacting us at **1-844-774-9229** ; or\n  2. Submitting your request at www.wellsfargo.com/privacycenter/.\n\nWells Fargo Online® customers and Wells Fargo employees: you can make a\nrequest by using your existing Wells Fargo log-in credentials.\n\nFor all other individuals, we will ask you to provide the following\ninformation to identify yourself:\n\n  * Name, contact information, Social Security or individual taxpayer identification number, and date of birth; and\n  * A copy of a government-issued photo ID. We accept your driver’s license, state ID, or matricula card.\n\nWhen you make a Request to Know, Delete, or Correct, we will attempt to verify\nthat you are who you say you are. For example, we will attempt to match\ninformation that you provide in making your Request with other sources of\nsimilar information to reasonably verify identity.\n\n**To make a Request to Opt-Out of Sharing, clickhere**. We also process opt-\nout preference signals, such as the Global Privacy Control, as required by the\nCCPA. These signals set the opt out of sharing preferences for the specific\nbrowser or device you are using. For information about how to use the Global\nPrivacy Control, please visit https://globalprivacycontrol.org/.\n\n## Responding to Requests\n\nPrivacy and data protection laws, other than the CCPA, apply to much of the\nPersonal Data that we handle. When these other laws apply, Personal Data may\nbe exempt from, or outside the scope of, a request to Know, Delete, or\nCorrect. For example, information subject to certain federal privacy laws,\nsuch as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act or the Health Insurance Portability and\nAccountability, is exempt from CCPA Requests. As a result, we may decline all\nor part of your Request to the extent that it relates to exempt Personal Data.\nThis means that we may not provide, delete, correct, or opt-out some, or all,\nof this Personal Data when you make a CCPA Request.\n\nAs examples, our processing of, or response to, a CCPA Request may not include\nsome or all of the following Personal Data:\n\n  * **Consumer Accounts.** Personal Data related to consumer accounts used for personal, family, or household purposes and applications for such accounts. We have other privacy notices providing certain information on use and sharing of this data, for example, the Wells Fargo U.S. Consumer Privacy Notice, available at www.wellsfargo.com/privacy-security.\n\nThe types of Personal Data described above are examples. We have not listed\nall types of Personal Data that may not be included when we respond to or\nprocess CCPA Requests.\n\nIn addition to the above examples, we may not include Personal Data when we\nrespond to or process CCPA Requests when the CCPA recognizes another\nexception. For example, we will not provide the Personal Data about another\nindividual when doing so would adversely affect the data privacy rights of\nthat individual. As another example, we will not delete Personal Data when it\nis necessary to maintain that Personal Data to comply with a legal obligation.\n\nWe will verify and respond to your request consistent with applicable law,\ntaking into account the type and sensitivity of the Personal Data subject to\nthe request.\n\n## Authorized Agents\n\nIf you are a California resident, you may authorize an agent to make a request\non your behalf. A California resident's authorized agent may make a request on\nbehalf of the California resident by using the submission methods listed above\nunder “How To Make Requests.” As part of our verification process, we may\nrequest that you provide, as applicable:\n\n  * For an individual (\"requestor\") making a request on behalf of a California resident: \n    * The requestor's name; contact information; Social Security or individual taxpayer identification number; date of birth; and driver’s license, state ID, or matricula card.\n    * The name; contact information; Social Security or individual taxpayer identification number; date of birth; and driver’s license, state ID, or matricula card of the California resident on whose behalf the request is being made.\n    * A document to confirm that the requestor is authorized to make the request.

We accept a letter on the legal entity requestor's letterhead, signed by an officer of the organization.

If you’re a Wells Fargo customer and use your Wells\nFargo Online® username and password at the start of your application. To\ndetermine which features of the online application are available with your\nhome loan, talk to a home mortgage consultant.  \n\n  * Apply online\n  * Complete a saved application\n\n**Talk to a consultant**\n\nYou can also connect with a home mortgage consultant and have a conversation –\nabout your home financing needs, your loan choices, and how much you may be\nable to borrow. When you’re ready, your home mortgage consultant will help you\ncomplete an application. Some features of the online application are not\navailable with all loans. Ask a home mortgage consultant for details.  \n\n  * Call 1-877-937-9357\n  * Get a call back\n  * Find a local consultant\n\n### Does Wells Fargo require a property inspection?\n\nIf you're buying a home, it's highly recommended that you obtain a property\ninspection and make your purchase offer contingent on the findings of the\ninspection.\n\nThere is a difference between a property inspection and an appraisal. An\nappraisal is required by most mortgage lenders in order to support the value\nof the real estate and the terms of the mortgage agreement.\n\n### Do I need an attorney?\n\nWhile there are many areas of the country where attorneys are not typically\nused in real estate transactions, some states do require an attorney. If\nyou're not sure of the state requirements, you can check with your home\nmortgage consultant.\n\n### What is the minimum down payment for conventional, FHA, and VA loans?\n\nWells Fargo offers several low down payment options, including conventional\nloans (those not backed by a government agency).\n\n  * Conventional fixed-rate loans are available with a down payment as low as 3%. \n    * Keep in mind that with a low down payment, mortgage insurance will be required, which increases the cost of the loan and will increase the monthly payment. We'll explain the options available, so you can choose what works for you.\n    * Talk with a home mortgage consultant about loan amount, loan type, property type, income, first-time homebuyer, and homebuyer education requirements to discuss eligibility.\n  * FHA loans are available with as little as 3.5% down. \n    * FHA loans have the benefit of a low down payment, but you'll want to consider all costs involved, including up-front and long-term mortgage insurance and all fees. Be certain to ask your home mortgage consultant to help you compare the overall costs of all your home financing options.\n  * VA loans offer low- and no-down-payment options for eligible veterans and other eligible borrowers. Up to 100% financing may be available on VA loans for qualified borrowers. \n\n### Can I make a mortgage payment online?\n\nYes, you can make a payment and manage your mortgage account online, anytime.\nGain instant access to your mortgage account details, loan history, tax and\ninterest data, contact information updates, and more. It's fast and simple.\nGet more details\n\n### Who do I contact if I am having trouble paying my mortgage?\n\nWe can help you understand your options if you are facing payment challenges.\nCall 1-800-678-7986.\n\n## More Information\n\n  * Mortgage FAQs\n\n## Resources\n\n  * Review mortgage and home equity payment options\n  * Learn about resources for homeowners with payment challenges\n  * Get disaster assistance and property damage information\n\n## Tools and Calculators\n\n  * Get prequalified\n  * Refinance\n  * Learn about home affordability\n\n## Applications and Rates\n\n  * Check loan Status\n  * Apply for an account or service\n  * Save and retrieve applications FAQs\n  * Review application status FAQs\n  * Check rates\n\nFor Wells Fargo customers who use their Wells Fargo Online® username and\npassword at the start of their application.\n\nCustomers must meet all eligibility requirements for the VA program.

With just an email address or U.S. mobile\nphone number, you can quickly, safely and easily send and receive money with\npeople you know and trust, regardless of where they bank.\n\n### Who can I send money to?\n\nYou can use Zelle® to send money to almost anyone with an eligible U.S.-based\nbank account. Eligibility requirements may vary depending on where your\nrecipient banks. For your protection, you should only use Zelle® when sending\nmoney to people and small businesses you know and trust.\n\nCheck with your recipient to ensure their correct email address or U.S. mobile\nphone number is enrolled in Zelle® so they can receive money.\n\n### What protections do I have when I use Zelle®?\n\nZelle® is intended to replace instances where cash and checks are being\nexchanged, you do not have the same protections associated with a credit card\nor a debit card transaction, such as the ability to dispute purchase\ntransactions. Once you send money with Zelle®, you cannot cancel the payment\nif your recipient has already enrolled. Neither Wells Fargo nor Zelle® offers\na protection program for any authorized payments made with Zelle® – for\nexample, if you do not receive the item you paid for or the item is not as\ndescribed or as you expected.\n\nWe recommend you only send money to known and trusted recipients when using\nZelle®.\n\n### Is there a fee for Zelle®?\n\nWells Fargo does not charge a fee to send or receive money with Zelle®.\nHowever, when using Zelle® on a mobile device, your mobile carrier’s message\nand data rates may apply. Account fees (e.g., monthly service, overdraft) may\napply to Wells Fargo account(s) with which you use Zelle®.\n\n### How much money can I send and receive with Zelle®?\n\n**Sending limits:** For your security, we restrict the amount of money you can\nsend to recipients. There are daily and 30-day (rolling) limits. The amounts\nyou can send daily and over 30 days will vary based on your funding account,\nyour recipient, your account and online banking history, and your payment\nhistory for each recipient.\n\n**Receiving limits:** We do not limit how much money you can receive with\nZelle®. However, the sender may be subject to limits on how much they can send\nyou, based on the policies of their financial institution.\n\nFor more information about Zelle® sending and receiving limits with Wells\nFargo, see the Zelle® Transfer Service Addendum. These limits apply only to\nZelle® payments when initiated from Wells Fargo Online® or the Wells Fargo\nMobile® app.\n\n### When will my payment arrive with Zelle®?\n\nOnce your recipient enrolls either a U.S. mobile phone number or email address\nwith Zelle®, payments are typically delivered within minutes. In some cases,\nwe may need to delay or block a payment for your protection.\n\n### What is the difference between the Zelle _®_ experience at Wells Fargo and\nthe separate Zelle _®_ app?\n\nWells Fargo partners with Zelle _®_ to offer a unique experience to our\ncustomers that is only available through Wells Fargo Online and Wells Fargo\nMobile. Other financial institutions may partner with Zelle _®_ and offer\ntheir own Zelle _®_ experience for their customers, subject to their own terms\nand conditions.\n\nThere is also a separate Zelle _®_ app that is not operated or maintained by\nWells Fargo or any other financial institution. Instead, it is operated by\nEarly Warning Services LLC, a third-party entity. The Zelle _®_ app is only\navailable for use by consumers whose US financial institution does not offer\nZelle _®_ to its customers. To send money to an eligible small business, both\nparties must be enrolled with Zelle® directly through their financial\ninstitution's online or mobile banking experience.\n\nFor more information, see the Zelle® Transfer Service Addendum.\n\n### Who are the Zelle® participating financial institutions?\n\nFor a full list of participating financial institutions, visit\nzellepay.com/partners.\n\nIf your recipient does not have an account with a Zelle® participating\nfinancial institution, you can still use Zelle® through Wells Fargo Online or\nWells Fargo Mobile to send them money from your personal account. They can use\nthe separate Zelle® app to receive the money, subject to eligibility\nrequirements and terms and conditions. To send money to an eligible small\nbusiness, both parties must be enrolled with Zelle® directly through their\nfinancial institution's online or mobile banking experience.\n\nRemember to only use Zelle® to send money to friends, family, and others you\nknow and trust.\n\n### How do I send money?\n\nFollow these steps to Send money with Zelle**®** :\n\n  1. Sign on and select **Transfer and Pay** on the desktop or **Pay & Transfer** on the mobile app.\n  2. Select Zelle®.\n  3. Select **Send**.\n  4. Select the recipient.\n  5. Enter the amount.\n  6. Select **Review**.\n  7. Select **Send**.\n\n### Will I receive text messages from Wells Fargo when I use Zelle®?\n\nWells Fargo may send you text messages related to your Zelle® activity (like\nwhen you add a new recipient or when you send money to a first-time\nrecipient). Wells Fargo text messages related to Zelle® will come from either\n93557 or 93729. You can stop text messages related to Zelle® by following the\ninstructions found in the body of the text messages.\n\nWells Fargo will need to verify your identity before processing some Zelle®\npayments, including when you send money to a first-time recipient. This step\nrequires us to send you a text message code. To complete this verification\nstep, you must have either a text-enabled mobile device or an RSA SecureID®\ndevice.\n\n### How do I request money with Zelle®?\n\n  1. Sign on and select **Pay & Transfer**.\n  2. Select Zelle®\n  3. From the Zelle® screen, select **Request**.\n  4. Select from your list of recipients or the **plus** (+) icon to add a new one.\n  5. Enter the amount you're requesting, double-check it to make sure it’s correct, then select **Request**.\n\nBefore you can request money, you must have enrolled an email address or U.S.\nmobile number with Zelle®. Note: Request money is not yet available on the\nWells Fargo Online desktop or tablet experience.\n\n### What do I do if my recipient never received my payment?\n\nIf your recipient did not receive your payment, make sure they’ve enrolled an\nemail address or U.S. mobile number with Zelle®. If they have enrolled, check\nthat the email address or U.S. mobile number you used to send money to your\nrecipient is associated with your recipient’s Zelle® profile.\n\nYou can check the payment status in your Zelle® **Activity**. In some cases,\npayments may be delayed or blocked for your protection.\n\nFor additional help, you can call Wells Fargo Online Customer Service at\n1-800-956-4442, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\n### Can I cancel a payment?\n\nIf your recipient has already enrolled with Zelle®, the payment is sent\ndirectly to their bank account and cannot be canceled. Keep in mind that\nZelle® payments are not covered by the same protections as credit card and\ndebit card payments.\n\nIf the payment is still pending because your recipient has not yet enrolled,\nyou may cancel it. Go to your **Z****elle****®** **Activity** , choose the\npayment you want to cancel, then select **Cancel Payment**.\n\nWe recommend that you only use Zelle® to send and receive money with people\nand small businesses you know and trust. Always remember to carefully verify\nyour recipient’s email address or U.S. mobile number before you send money.\n\n### Is my information secure?\n\nKeeping your money and information safe is a top priority for Wells Fargo.\nWhen you use Zelle® within our mobile app or online banking, your information\nis protected with the same technology we use to keep your Wells Fargo account\nsafe.\n\n### Can I use Zelle® internationally?\n\nIn order to use Zelle®, the sender and recipient’s bank or credit union\naccounts must be based in the U.S.\n\n## Donations to the American Red Cross using Zelle®\n\n### How do I donate money to the American Red Cross using Zelle®?\n\nSign on to the Wells Fargo Mobile app > Pay & Transfer > Zelle > Send > select\n+ to add a recipient.

Contributions to the American Red Cross are tax-deductible to\nthe extent permitted by law. The American Red Cross' tax identification number\nis 53-0196605.\n\nReceipts will be issued upon request for donations greater than $250 by the\nAmerican Red Cross.\n\n### What is my donation being used for?\n\n100% of your donation will go directly to help the American Red Cross Disaster\nRelief. Your donation helps the Red Cross prepare for, respond to, and help\npeople recover from nearly 64,000 disasters a year nationwide like hurricanes,\nwildfires, earthquakes, and countless other crises.\n\nEnrollment with Zelle® through Wells Fargo Online® or Wells Fargo Business\nOnline® is required. Terms and conditions apply. To send or receive money with\nZelle®, both parties must have an eligible checking or savings account\nenrolled with Zelle® through their bank. Transactions between enrolled users\ntypically occur in minutes. For your protection, Zelle® should only be used\nfor sending money to friends, family, or others you trust.

The objective of the \neffort in this report is to identify a range of possible futures for the U.S. electricity sector while \nseeking to illuminate specific energy system issues and discussing future trends in outcomes \nsuch as energy technology deployment and production, energy costs, and emissions. \nThis effort is supported by the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Office of Energy Efficiency \nand Renewable Energy (EERE). It leverages significant activity already funded by EERE to \nbetter understand individual technologies, their roles in the larger energy system, and market and \npolicy issues that can impact the evolution of the electricity sector.  \nSpecific products from this effort include: \n• An Annual Technology Baseline (ATB) workbook documenting detailed cost and \nperformance data (both current and projected) for various generation technologies  \n• An ATB summary website describing each of the technologies and providing additional \ncontext for their treatment in the workbook \n• This Standard Scenarios scenario framework, report, and data set describing U.S. electricity \nsector futures  \n• The Cambium data sets, which contain a broader suite of metrics for a subset of scenarios \nfrom this report.  \nThese products can be accessed at atb.nrel.gov, www.nrel.gov/analysis/standard-scenarios.html\n, \nand www.nrel.gov/analysis/cambium.html. \nThese products are built and applied to analyses to ensure (1) the analyses incorporate a \ntransparent, realistic, and timely set of input assumptions and (2) they consider a diverse set \nof potential futures. The application of standard scenarios, clear documentation of underlying \nassumptions, and model versioning is expected to result in: \n• Improved transparency of modeling input assumptions and methodologies \n• Improved comparability of results across studies \n• Improved consideration of the potential economic and environmental impacts of \nvarious electricity sector futures  \n• An enhanced framework for formulating and addressing new analysis questions.  \nThis report documents the eighth edition of the annual Standard Scenarios. Most of this year’s \nscenarios include representations of the main electricity sector provisions from the Inflation \nReduction Act of 2022 (IRA). Forthcoming studies include a more detailed analysis of the \nimpacts of IRA on the U.S. electric sector. Future analyses are expected to build on the \nassumptions used here and provide increasingly sophisticated views of the future U.S. electric \nsector and its interactions with other sectors of the U.S. energy economy.",

The original report described the CO2 metrics as only including \nemissions from generators, and has been corrected to indicate that the metrics also include the \neffects of CO\n2 capture from direct air capture technologies in the five sensitivities that include \ndirect air capture technologies.

It summarizes 70 \nforward-looking scenarios of the U.S. electricity sector that have been designed to capture a wide \nrange of possible futures.  \nIn August 2022, the United States Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), a law \naimed at accelerating U.S. decarbonization, clean energy manufacturing, and deployment of new \npower and end-use technologies. This year’s scenarios include representations of the main \nelectricity-sector provisions from IRA and the potential impact on electricity demand.\n1  \nThe Standard Scenarios are simulated using the Regional Energy Deployment System (ReEDS) \nmodel, which projects utility-scale electricity sector evolution for the contiguous United States \nusing a system-wide, least-cost approach subject to policy and operational constraints. A subset \nof the scenarios are simulated in the PLEXOS production cost model to obtain a broader suite of \nmetrics at the hourly resolution, which are made available through the National Renewable \nEnergy Laboratory’s (NREL’s) annual Cambium data sets. \nThe scenarios can be viewed and downloaded from NREL’s Scenario Viewer. Annual results are \navailable for the full suite of scenarios in the Standard Scenarios projects in the viewer, whereas \nthe Cambium projects contain hourly data for a subset of scenarios. \nThe Standard Scenarios includes a scenario called the Mid-case, which has central or median \nvalues for core inputs such as technology costs and fuel prices, moderately paced demand growth \naveraging 1.3% per year, and electricity sector policies as they existed in September 2022 \n(including IRA). The remaining 69 scenarios are created by varying inputs such as technology \nand fuel prices, resource availability, demand growth, whether nascent generation technologies \nare allowed, and by introducing national decarbonization constraints.  \nWe highlight four observations from this year’s projections: \n1. Wind and solar grow significantly, making up the majority of new generation: By \n2050 wind and solar generation reach 1500 TWh/year and 1600 TWh/year (a 3.5x and 7x \nincrease over current levels respectively) in the Mid-case. Across all the scenarios that \ninclude IRA, their generation ranges from 1400-3000 TWh/year for wind and 1300-3100 \nTWh/year for solar.   \n2. Still-nascent technologies can play a role: Retrofits of natural gas and coal plants with \ncarbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies often occur, with contributions peaking at \n230 TWh/year and 100 TWh/year respectively in the Mid-case. Biopower with CCS, \nelectricity-powered direct air capture, and renewable fuel combustion turbines are only \ndeployed in scenarios where national decarbonization constraints are imposed.   \n \n1 IRA is large and complex. Our representation does not include all provisions that may influence the electricity \nsector, and the provisions that are represented are generally simplifications. See Section 2.3 for details.",

U.S. electricity sector emissions decrease significantly through the 2030s: Compared \nto 2021 emissions, annual U.S. national electricity-sector CO2 emissions in 2035 are \nreduced by 77% in the Mid-case and 46%-87% across all scenarios with current policies \n(including IRA).  \n4. A phaseout of IRA’s tax credits may result in emissions rebounding in later years: \nIRA's tax credits are either scheduled to phase out at the end of 2032 or when an \nemissions threshold is met, depending on the credit. In scenarios where the emissions \nthreshold is met, the corresponding phaseout of the PTC and ITC can reverse several \ntrends. For example, in the Mid-case the lowest annual CO\n2 emissions of 300 MMT/year \nis seen in 2038, but the phaseout of tax credits results in a later-year rebound to 750 \nMMT/year by 2050. These reversals are not seen in scenarios where the PTC and ITC do \nnot expire, or where decarbonization trajectories are imposed.  \nTo illustrate some of these trends, we show the generation and capacity trends for five scenarios \nbelow. One scenario is the Mid-case mentioned previously, and the other four share the same \ncore assumptions as the Mid-case but with national electricity sector decarbonization constraints \nand/or the exclusion of nascent technologies: \n1. The Mid-case: central estimates for inputs such as technology costs, fuel prices, and \ndemand growth, with electricity sector policies as they existed in September 2022  \n2. The Mid-case with 95% Decarbonization by 2050: the same set of core assumption as \nthe Mid-case but with a national electricity sector decarbonization constraint that linearly \ndeclines to 5% of 2005 emissions on net by 2050  \n3. The Mid-case with 100% Decarbonization by 2035: the same set of core assumption as \nthe Mid-case but with a national electricity sector decarbonization constraint that linearly \ndeclines to zero net emissions by 2035 \n4. The Mid-case without Nascent Technologies:2 the same set of core assumptions as \nthe Mid-case but where nascent electricity sector technologies are not included \n5. The Mid-case with 95% Decarbonization by 2050 without Nascent Technologies: \na case equivalent to the Mid-case with 95% decarbonization by 2050 scenario but where \nnascent electricity sector technologies are not included.  \n \n2 Nascent technologies are defined here as enhanced geothermal systems, floating offshore wind, coal CCS, natural \ngas CCS, biopower CCS, small modular nuclear reactors, and renewable fuel combustion turbines. See Section 2.2 \nfor a list of established technologies.",

Each sensitivity is performed for the five combinations of CO2 emission limits and \ntechnology sets that were shown for the Mid-cases in Figures ES-1 and ES-2. \nFigure ES-3 shows the annual generation by technology class for the full suite of scenarios. Note \nthat a set of sensitivities were performed with pre-IRA federal policies, and labelled in Figure \nES-3, to illustrate IRA’s impact. In general, IRA decreases generation from non-CCS natural gas \nand non-CCS coal, while increasing generation from solar, wind, CCS natural gas, and CCS \ncoal. As previously mentioned in highlight #4 above, the reversal of some trends in the later \nyears of some scenarios (e.g., the decline and subsequent rise of natural gas generation in the \nCurrent Policies Mid-case) is caused by the expiration of IRA’s tax credits, which start to phase \nout after 2032 or when U.S. electricity sector CO2 emissions reach 25% of 2022 levels \n(whichever is later).

The emission threshold in IRA is specified relative to 2022 emissions, \nwhich are not yet known at the time of publication, and therefore approximated as the emissions from \nJune 2021 through May 2022 (1560 MMT CO2, for a corresponding threshold of 390 MMT CO2). \nFigure ES-5 compares the Mid-case (previously shown in Figure ES-1) against a sensitivity with \nidentical assumptions except that IRA’s PTC and ITC are extended through 2050. We can see \nthat, when those credits do not phase out, renewable generators continue to be deployed in later \nyears.",

    "page_content": "1 \nThis report is available at no cost from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory at www.nrel.gov/publications. \n1 Introduction \nThe U.S. electricity sector continues to undergo rapid change because of evolutions in \ntechnologies, markets, and policies. To help advance the understanding of the implications, \ndrivers, and key uncertainties associated with this change, we are providing this eighth\n3 \ninstallment of the Standard Scenarios. This year’s Standard Scenarios consist of 70 electricity \nsector scenarios for the contiguous United States that consider the present day through 2050 and \ninclude a representation of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.  \nThe Standard Scenarios are simulated using the Regional Energy Deployment System (ReEDS) \nmodel, which projects utility-scale electricity sector evolution for the contiguous United States \nusing a system-wide, least-cost approach subject to policy and operational constraints (Ho et al. \n2021). ReEDS draws from the Distributed Generation Market Demand Model (dGen) for \nprojections of behind-the-meter solar adoption. 4  \nThe objective of the Standard Scenarios is to explore a range of possible future conditions and \nhow the U.S. electricity sector may evolve under those conditions. Although we strive to produce \nreasonable projections of the future, these projections should not be the sole basis for making \ndecisions. We encourage analysts to draw from multiple scenarios within the full set, as well as \ndraw from projections from other sources, to benefit from diverse analytical frameworks and \nperspectives when forming their conclusions about the future of the electricity sector.  \nOur models, in particular, have been designed to capture the unique traits of renewable energy \ngeneration technologies and the resulting implications for the evolution of the electricity sector. \nWe aim to accurately capture issues related to renewable energy integration, including capacity \nadequacy and interactions of curtailment and storage on investment decisions. Other modeling \nand analysis frameworks will have different emphases, strengths, and weaknesses. The work we \nreport here provides a perspective that complements those provided by others. \nAlthough the models used to develop the Standard Scenarios are sophisticated, they do not \ncapture every relevant factor. For example, the models do not explicitly model supply chains, \nlearning-by-doing, or permitting, as just several examples. Additionally, ReEDS does not have \nforesight, has a simplified representation of transmission networks, and takes a system-wide \nplanning approach when making decisions rather than representing specific market actors or \nrules. Therefore, results should be interpreted within the context of model limitations. A more \ncomplete list of model-specific caveats is available in the models’ documentation (Ho et al. \n2021, Section 1.4; Sigrin et al. 2016, Section 2.2). \nIn addition to this report, which focuses on high level trends, state-level outputs are available for \nviewing and downloading through NREL’s Scenario Viewer.\n5 \n \n3 See atb.nrel.gov/archive for the previous Standard Scenarios reports and data. \n4 For more information about ReEDS and dGen, see www.nrel.gov/analysis/reeds and www.nrel.gov/analysis/dgen, \nrespectively. For lists of published work using ReEDS and dGen, see www.nrel.gov/analysis/reeds/publications.html \nand www.nrel.gov/analysis/dgen/publications.html respectively. \n5 The data viewer (scenarioviewer.nrel.gov) provides additional state-specific data from the scenarios; however, we \nnote that as a national-scale model, ReEDS is not specifically designed to assess in detail the full circumstances of \nany individual state.",

Scenario assumptions have been \nupdated since 2021 to reflect the technology, market, and policy changes that have occurred in \nthe electricity sector, and many modeling enhancements have been made (see Section A.2 in the \nappendix for a complete list of changes). Of particular note, this year’s Standard Scenarios \nincludes provisions from the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA). The representation of the \nIRA provisions is discussed in Section 2.3.  \nThe scenarios included in this report are summarized in Figure 1 (page 3). Details about specific \nscenario definitions and inputs are provided in Section A.1 of the appendix. \nThe 70 scenarios were selected to capture a wide range key drivers of electricity sector evolution, \nsuch as the cost and performance of technologies and fuel. The diversity of scenarios is intended \nto cover a range of potential futures. For example, in addition to considering traditional \nsensitivities such as demand growth and fuel prices, we also assess other factors that can impact \nthe development of the electricity sector, such as transmission build-out and technology progress. \nWe encourage those doing analyses that use data from these scenarios to draw from multiple \nscenarios, to reflect the inherent uncertainty in the evolution of the US electricity sector. \nAlthough the scenario suite covers a wide range of futures, it is not exhaustive. We note that \nother NREL analyses have studied particular aspects of power sector evolution in more depth \nthen is covered in this suite of scenarios. For example: \n• The 100% Clean Electricity By 2035 Study\n has a broader suite of electricity sector \ndecarbonization scenarios that explores different policy designs and the technologies that \nmay come into play in such a future.  \n• The Electrification Futures Study explores a broader range of end-use electrification, \nprovides more data describing those electrification trajectories, and conducts a more \nthorough exploration of the possible role of demand-side flexibility.  \n• The Storage Futures Study takes a closer look at the possible role of energy storage \ntechnologies.  \n• The annually released Cambium data sets provide a broader suite of metrics at hourly \nresolution for a subset of the Standard Scenarios.  \nAdditionally, forthcoming work will explore the impacts of IRA in more detail than is presented \nhere.

For readers interested in a more detailed exploration of zero-carbon \nsystems under a 2035 timeframe, we direct them to NREL’s \n100% Clean Electricity by 2035 \nStudy (Denholm et al. 2022).   \n2.1 Definition of Decarbonization Scenarios in the \nStandard Scenarios \nIn the 2022 Standard Scenarios, two electricity sector CO2 trajectories are applied to a subset of \nthe scenarios: the 95% Reduction by 2050 and the 100% Reduction by 2035. These trajectories \ncorrespond to a percentage reduction in net U.S. electricity sector CO\n2 emissions relative to 2005 \nemissions.  \nThese trajectories are implemented as a national electricity sector CO2 constraint. The CO2 \nconstraint only apply to the U.S. electricity sector. None of the scenarios in this analysis model \ninternational or economy-wide decarbonization, which would impact factors such as fuel prices, \ngenerator costs, and the magnitude and shape of electricity demand.  \nThe trajectories limit the net electricity sector emissions, meaning that the constraint is applied to \nCO2 emissions from the direct combustion of fuel for electricity generation, less any CO2 \ncaptured and stored through carbon capture technologies (biopower with CCS or direct air \ncapture, if present). The emission limit does not incorporate other greenhouse gases, emissions \nfrom precombustion or post-combustion activities such as fuel extraction and transport (other \nthan the CO2 removed from the atmosphere during feedstock growth for biopower with CCS), or \nthe emissions induced by construction or decommissioning activities.  \nNote that, in the scenarios that exclude nascent technologies, there are no carbon removal \noptions—and that direct air capture is only included in the sensitivity which bears its name.  \nThe definition of a CO2 constraint given above is only one possible definition—others may \ninclude the CO2 equivalence of other greenhouse gasses or include non-combustion emissions \n(e.g., emissions from fuel extraction, processing, and transport). Furthermore, other definitions \nmay involve different approaches to the accounting around carbon removal, including \ncompletely prohibiting offsets. Other possible definitions of power sector decarbonization were \nexplored in NREL’s 100% Clean Electricity by 2035 Study.  \n2.2 Technology Sets \nEach scenario in the 2022 Standard Scenarios has one of two different generation technology sets \navailable to the ReEDS model: a relatively conservative set that only has technologies that have \nachieved commercial procurement in the United States and a broader set that includes nascent \ntechnologies (Table 1).",

Indeed, many of the \ntechnologies have high technology readiness levels, and some have operational demonstration \nplants. Nonetheless, even if a technology is technically viable, there is still great uncertainty \nabout its future cost and performance, as well as a lack of understanding of other considerations \nrelevant to projecting their adoption, such as siting preferences and restrictions. Given these \nuncertainties, we chose to present a set of scenarios that does not include these technologies.  \n2.3 Representation of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 \nThe 2022 Standard Scenarios includes a representation of the main electricity sector provisions \nfrom the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA). We note that, while we believe that our \nrepresentation of IRA is adequate to characterize the type of electric-sector trends explored in \nthis report, not all of IRA’s provisions are represented. Additionally, as with any modeling of \ncomplex policy, the representation of the provisions are generally simplifications. We highlight \nthese omissions and simplifications below, and where analysts are using the data provided to \nperform derivative analyses, we encourage them to reflect critically on whether any omission is \nimpactful for their specific purpose.   \nFour electricity sector tax credits are represented in ReEDS: \n• Production Tax Credit (PTC): $26/MWh for 10 years (2022 dollars) plus a bonus credit \nthat starts at $1.3/MWh and increases to $2.6/MWh by 2028  \n• Investment Tax Credit (ITC): 30%, plus a bonus credit that starts at an additional 5% and \nincreases to 10% by 2028 (for totals of 35% and 40% respectively)  \n• Captured CO\n2 Incentive (45Q): $85 per metric ton of CO2 for 12 years for fossil-CCS and \nbioenergy-CCS, and $180 per metric ton of CO2 for 12 years for direct air capture; nominal \nthrough 2026 and inflation adjusted after that  \n• Existing Nuclear Production Tax Credit (45U): This tax credit is $15/MWh (2022 \ndollars), but it is reduced if the market value of the electricity produced by the generator \nexceeds $25/MWh. As a simplification, this dynamic calculation was not directly represented \nin ReEDS. Instead, to represent the effect of this provision, existing nuclear generators are \nnot subject to economic retirement in ReEDS through 2032.  \nNote that IRA allows for bonus credits for both the PTC and ITC (but not applicable to 45Q or \n45U) if a project either meet certain domestic manufacturing requirements or is in an “energy \ncommunity.” Projects can obtain both bonus credits if they meet both requirements, which would \nequate to $5.2/MWh for the PTC and 20% for the ITC. In ReEDS, we assume projects will, on \naverage, capture one of the bonus credits by 2028, the value of which is expressed in the \nsummary above. In practice, there will likely be greater diversity of captured credits amongst \nprojects. Relatedly, the values above are based on the assumption that all projects will meet the \nprevailing wage requirements.",

As implemented in \nReEDS, however, an a priori analysis was performed to estimate which credit was most likely to \nbe more valuable, and the technology was assigned that credit. The assignments are: \n• PTC: Onshore wind, utility-scale PV, and biopower  \n• ITC: Offshore wind, CSP, geothermal, hydropower, new nuclear, pumped storage \nhydropower, distributed PV, and batteries.  \nIn previous implementations of tax credits in ReEDS, the value of tax credits was reduced by \n33% as a simple representation of the costs of monetizing the tax credits (such as tax equity \nfinancing). Due to provisions in IRA that make it easier to monetize the tax credits, that cost \npenalty is reduced to 10% for non-CCS technologies and 7.5% for CCS technologies.7 These \ncost penalties are not reflected in the values given for each incentive above.  \nThe PTC and ITC are scheduled to start phasing out when electricity sector emissions fall below \n25% of 2022 levels, or 2032, whichever is later. Because 2022 emissions are not known at the \ntime of publication, the emissions are estimated as the emissions from June 2021 through May \n2022 (1560 MMT CO2). This equates to a phase-out threshold of 390 MMT CO2.  The 45Q and \n45U credits do not have a dynamic phaseout and are instead just scheduled to end at the end of \n2032.  \nIn the dGen model, distributed PV was assumed to take an ITC: the 25D credit for residential, \nand the Section 48 credit for commercial and industrial. For residential projects placed in service \nthrough 2032 the ITC was assumed to be 30%, declining to zero for projects placed in service in \n2036. For commercial and industrial projects coming online through 2035 the ITC was assumed \nto be 40%, dropping to zero after that. These representations are simplifications, as there can be \ngreater diversity in captured value depending on factors such as ownership type and tax status. \nFurthermore, due to limitations of the models used in this study, the dynamic phase-out of the \nSection 48 ITC was not reflected. In practice, many scenarios did not cross the emissions \nthreshold specified in IRA at this point, and therefore the adoption of commercial and industrial \ndistributed PV in the later years of those scenarios was potentially underestimated.  \nIRA includes additional bonus credits (up to 20%) for up to 1.8 GW per year for solar facilities \nthat are placed in service in low-income communities. The dGen model runs used in this analysis \ndid not have an explicit representation of that additional bonus credit. Instead, 0.9 GW per year \nof distributed PV was added to the original dGen estimates through 2032. The estimate of 0.9 \nGW reflects the assumption that some of the projects capturing the bonus credit may not be \nadditional (i.e., they would have occurred anyway even if the bonus credit was not available).  \nAll the IRA tax credits are assumed to have safe harbor periods, meaning a technology can \ncapture a credit as long as it started construction before the expiration of the tax credit. The \nmaximum safe harbor periods are assumed to be 10 years for offshore wind, 6 years for CCS and \nnuclear, and 4 years for all other technologies. Generators will obtain the largest credit available \nwithin their safe harbor window, meaning that once a credit starts to phase down or terminate, \nReEDS assumes that efforts were made to start construction at the maximum length of the safe \n \n7 CCS projects are eligible for a direct pay option for the first 5 years of the 45Q credit or until 2032 (whichever \ncomes first), with the credits returning to non-refundable status after that point. The lower monetization penalty is \nmeant to approximate the benefit of the direct pay option.",

We emphasize that the use of this modified trajectory is just an initial approximation \nof the impact of the demand-side IRA provisions, and we expect more thorough modeling and \nanalysis to be developed later.",

    "page_content": "9 \nThis report is available at no cost from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory at www.nrel.gov/publications. \n3 The Mid-Case Scenarios \nThe Mid-case scenarios use central assumptions for demand growth, resource  availability, fuel \nprice, and technology inputs (see  Figure 1, page 3, for a summary of those assumptions and \nAppendix A.1 for  details about the assumptions ). In this  way, the Mid -case scenario s provide \nreference points for comparing scenarios and assessing  trends. Section 3.1 provides some \nadditional context for how the Mid-case scenario relates to projections from other organizations. \nFigure 2 (page 11) shows the generation and capacity mix through 2050 for the Mid-case \nscenarios, with nascent technologies included, under the three levels of electricity sector \ndecarbonization. The Current Policies trajectory does not impose any CO2 emission limit other \nthan those already in place, the 95% by 2050 trajectory imposes a net 95% reduction in national \nelectricity sector CO2 emissions by 2050 relative to 2005, and the 100% by 2035 trajectory \nrequires that national CO2 emissions are net zero by 2035. Direct air capture is not enabled in \nthese scenarios, but biopower with carbon capture is available to offset stack emissions from \ncarbon-emitting generators. \nAll three scenarios see significant increases in wind, solar, and storage deployment. In part \nbecause of this deployment, all three scenarios hit the 75% emissions reduction threshold \nspecified in IRA, and consequently the PTC and the ITC phase out in the 2030s. In the scenario \nwith current policies, this results in a reversal of several trends, as the absence of the PTC results \nin wind capacity declining in the 2040s (from retirements that are not repowered) and natural gas \ngeneration increasing. The tax credits also expire in the other two scenarios, but their \ndecarbonization trajectories largely prevent the same reversals. \nWith the increased value of the 45Q incentive for captured carbon in IRA, all three scenarios see \nfossil-CCS deployed. In both the scenario with current policies as well as the 95% by 2050 \nscenario there is an initial retrofitting of natural gas plants with CCS, which then operate at their \nmaximum capacity factor for the 12-year duration of the 45Q credit. However, once the credit \nexpires for those plants, they revert to much lower capacity factors while primarily providing \nfirm capacity.\n8 In the 100% by 2035 scenario, natural gas units are likewise retrofitted in the late \n2020s and their generation contribution remains consistent after that even as they lose the 45Q \ncredit, as their carbon emissions are offset by bioenergy with CCS plants.  \nThe Current Policies and 95% by 2050 scenarios also see coal-CCS retrofits in the 2030s. The \ndeployment of these plants, which is later than natural gas CCS, is driven by the cost trajectory \nfor retrofitting coal plants (see Section A.1 in the appendix), which is assumed to be the \ndifference between greenfield CCS and non-CCS plants, plus a 20% adder. We emphasize that, \nas with all technologies, and especially nascent technologies, the ultimate deployment of these \ngenerators is sensitive to their future costs. More rapid reductions in the cost of retrofitting could \nsee earlier deployment of coal-CCS, whereas slower cost reductions could see the 45Q credit \nterminate before widespread retrofitting becomes economical. \n \n8 Note that ReEDS does not have the ability to operate CCS generators with their capture equipment turned off, or to \nremove the equipment entirely. In practice, these generators may disable their capture equipment once they are no \nlonger capturing the 45Q credit.",

The capacity persists by running at lower utilization \nrates and, in the 100% by 2035 scenario, by having its emissions offset using biopower with \nCCS. These natural gas generators, along with other resources such as nuclear, hydropower, \nstorage, and geothermal plants, provide a source of firm capacity for periods with low wind and \nsolar output. Firm capacity is especially important in the winter when solar resources are low and \nload tends to be high (Cole, Greer, et al. 2020). \nBioenergy with CCS generation capacity is deployed in both the 95% by 2050 scenario and the \n100% by 2035 scenario. Renewable fuel combustion turbines are also deployed, primarily for \nproviding firm capacity, in the 100% by 2035 scenario. We note that IRA includes incentives for \nhydrogen production (one of several potential fuels that could be used in renewable generators), \nand while this analysis did not explicitly incorporate that incentive, it could play a role in \nbringing the cost of hydrogen down to the $20/MMBtu assumed in these scenarios. \nExisting nuclear plants are not subject to economic retirement through 2032, due to ReEDS’ \ninterpretation of the IRA incentives for existing nuclear, and beyond 2032, they generally remain \nsufficiently competitive to avoid early retirement,\n9 resulting in a near-constant level of nuclear \ncapacity and generation through 2050. No new nuclear is added in the Mid-case scenarios, even \nwith stringent CO2 limits. \n \n9 Nuclear power plants have an assumed lifetime of 80 years within the model unless an earlier retirement date has \nbeen announced.",

Nonetheless, we plot these results to enable \nreaders to compare NREL’s historical projections against other organizations, and to place \nNREL’s new projections alongside a wider range of pre-IRA estimates.  \nTwo other early analyses of IRA’s potential impact have estimated that it could bring annual \nU.S. economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions down to 40% of 2005 levels by 2030 (DOE 2022) \nand 58% of 2005 levels by 2030 (Jesse D. Jenkins et al. 2022). Note that the projections shown \nin Figure 4 are only for the U.S. electricity sector, not the whole economy.  \nAlthough NREL and most of these organizations publish multiple scenarios that span a wide \nrange of assumptions, this comparison uses only the “reference” scenarios.11 Note that the \ndecrease in renewable energy share and increase in CO2 emissions in this year’s projections from \nNREL are driven mostly by an increase in natural gas generation from already-existing \ngenerators, not from a decrease in renewable energy generation. This is caused by the expiration \nof IRA’s tax credits, as discussed previously in this report. For reference, a line has been added \nshowing the trends in NREL’s projections under Mid-case assumptions, but where IRA’s PTC \nand ITC are extended through the modeling horizon.   \n \n10 The NREL scenario is the Current Policies (previously No New Policy) Mid-case including nascent technologies. \nThe BNEF case is the New Energy Outlook scenario. The EIA case is the Annual Energy Outlook Reference Case. \nThe IEA is the World Energy Outlook Stated Policies scenario. Note that the IEA’s World Energy Outlook 2022 was \nnot yet available at the time of this writing and that in 2021 BNEF changed their forecasts to be centered on the \npathways for power sector decarbonization, and therefore are no longer updated here. \n11 The input assumptions, including the policies represented differ among these reference scenarios.",

This clustering should not be \ninterpreted as indicating a higher likelihood. \nFigure 5 (page 17) shows the generation by fuel type across the full suite of scenarios. Natural \ngas, solar, and wind show the largest range in 2050 generation across the scenarios. Natural gas \nhas an especially wide range in the Current Policies scenarios, and its contribution in the \nscenarios with national emissions limits is generally less but also sensitive to the specific policy \n(95% or 100% decarbonization) and the presence or absence of carbon removal technologies. \nNon-CCS coal generation tends to decline over time, although some of the decline is from the \nretrofitting of existing generators with CCS. Nuclear generation remains largely steady across \nmost of the scenarios, with growth only coming in scenarios that assume low nuclear costs. \nSome scenarios see a slight decline in nuclear generation (without a corresponding decline in \nnuclear capacity) due to decreases use induced by relatively higher VRE deployment. \nSome scenarios have a reversal in trends in the 2040s (e.g., the increase in natural gas and \ndecline in wind generation in the Current Policies Mid-case) that is caused by the expiration of \nthe PTC and ITC once emissions have been reduced by 75%.

Energy costs tend to decline over time, until the 75% emissions reduction \nthreshold specified in IRA is reached, at which point the PTC and ITC phase out and energy \nprices increase. \nMarginal planning reserve costs grow over time as planning reserve margins tighten relative to \ntoday’s levels (by the end of the 2020s, the ReEDS model has all regions exactly meeting the \nNorth American Electric Reliability Corporation-recommended planning reserve levels). The \nespecially high planning reserve costs in a subset of the 95% by 2050 CO2 scenarios are the \ncases where no nascent generator technologies are included in the model, which leads to \nrelatively higher marginal costs for firm capacity. \n \n \nFigure 11. National annual average marginal costs for energy and capacity services. The Mid-case \nscenarios with the full technology set (including nascent technologies) are shown with the heavier dashed \nlines. Costs are in 2021 dollars.  \nFigure 12 shows the annual curtailed energy from wind and solar generators, in terms of both \nabsolute amounts of curtailment as well as the percentage of total wind and solar generation. \nThere are two groups of scenarios with exceptionally high curtailment rates: the first is the \nscenarios with low-cost wind and solar, all of which pass 10% curtailment in the 2030s, and then \ndecline over time as the PTC and ITC phase out. The second are various scenarios with 95% \nemissions reduction in 2050 and no nascent technologies. \nScenarios \nWithout \nNascent \nTechnologies",

    "page_content": "30 \nThis report is available at no cost from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory at www.nrel.gov/publications. \nDemand Growth and Flexibility \nThe Mid-case scenarios contain a demand growth trajectory that is meant to reflect light \nelectrification induced in part by the demand-side provisions of IRA. The trajectory was created \nby taking the Medium Electrification scenario from the Electrification Futures Study (Mai et al. \n2018) and reducing the rate of electricity growth such that the original values that were reached \nin 2046 are instead reached in 2050. This rate of growth was selected such that the level of \nelectrification in 2050 was approximately halfway between the AEO2022 (EIA 2022a) \nReference case and the original Medium Electrification scenario. We emphasize that this is only \na simple estimate and that users should look to forthcoming work from NREL and others that \ndevelops more-sophisticated estimates of future demand growth.  \nThe low demand growth scenario is based on the AEO2022 Reference scenario load growth. The \nhigh demand growth scenario is the High Electrification with Moderate end-use technology \nadvancement scenario from the Electrification Futures Study (Jadun et al. 2017).  \nThe demand trajectories have compound annual growth rates of 0.91%, 1.27%, and 1.99% from \n2022 through 2050. We assume inelastic, inflexible electricity demand in all scenarios. \n  \nFigure A-1. Demand trajectories used in the Standard Scenarios \nThe Reference trajectory is used in the Mid-case set of assumptions.  \nThe demand shapes are illustrated in Tables A-2 through A-5. The demand shapes shown are the \nnational month-hour average demand, divided by the national annual average demand. Table A-2 \nshows the demand shape in 2022 in the reference demand trajectory, which is nearly identical to \nthe demand shape in the other trajectories in 2022. The next three tables show the demand shapes \nin 2050. While there are broad similarities (e.g., all have summer evening peaks, and are lowest \nduring the nighttime in the spring and fall), there are also some differences; most notably in the \nhigher winter loads in the high-growth scenarios, driven by heating electrification. Some regions \nsee much greater variation than is seen in these national plots, with some switching from being \nsummer-peaking to winter-peaking systems.",

Input coal and uranium fuel prices used in the Standard Scenarios \nUranium prices are the same across the United States. Coal prices vary by census region, and as \nlisted in descending order of average price in the legend in this figure.  \nRenewable fuel combustion turbines (RE-CT) are represented consistent with the Solar Futures \nStudy (DOE 2021) and Cole et al. (2021). These RE-CT technologies have a renewably derived \ninput fuel (e.g., hydrogen, biodiesel, ethanol, or green methane) that is assumed to cost \n$20/MMBtu in 2022 dollars at any point in time, in these scenarios. The additional electric load \nfrom the production of a renewably derived fuel is not incorporated into these scenarios. The \nactual delivered cost that a renewably derived fuel could achieve is, like all future costs, highly \nuncertain. Current delivered prices for fuels like hydrogen are significantly higher than assumed \nhere (e.g., the cost of delivering hydrogen\n via liquid tankers, not including production costs, was \nestimated at $68/MMBtu in 2021 dollars in 2020 (DOE 2020), although such delivery costs \nwould be expected to decrease significantly if pipeline infrastructure were built). NREL’s \nAnnual Technology Baseline (ATB) estimates that the delivered price of hydrogen could reach \n$56/MMBtu (in 2021 dollars) when using high temperature electrolysis in futures with high \nvolume markets—although the ATB estimates do not include the incentives for hydrogen \nproduction in IRA, which can be as high as $22/MMBtu. \nTechnology Cost and Performance \nTechnology cost and performance assumptions are taken from the 2022 ATB (NREL 2022). \nThe ATB includes advanced, moderate, and conservative cost and performance projections \nthrough 2050 for the generating and storage technologies used in the ReEDS and dGen models. \nThe low renewable energy (RE) and battery cost scenarios use the advanced projections for all \nrenewable energy and battery technologies, and the high RE and battery cost scenarios use the \nconservative projections (for these scenarios, RE technologies include all solar, geothermal, \nhydropower, and wind generators). Scenarios with low CCS costs use the advanced coal and \nnatural gas CCS technology projections from the ATB. Low nuclear costs are not available in \nthe ATB, so to create a low nuclear cost projection, we assume nuclear capital and fixed \noperation and maintenance costs for small modular reactor technologies decline to 50% below",

For land-based wind, additional setbacks and land exclusions are applied that reduce the \nresource available to 2.03 TW, compared with 6.64 terawatts (TW) in the default case. The \nreductions vary by region and are largely based on the methods and assumptions from Lopez et \nal. (2021), but updated to consider the impacts of shadow flicker. A similar method is applied for \noffshore wind, where the deployable resource is reduced from 4.27 TW in the default cases to \n2.12 TW with more stringent siting constraints. These reductions stem primarily from lower \ncapacity density to accommodate fishing and shipping industries through required 1-nuatical \nmile spacing of turbines and from greater setbacks from shore as a proxy for coastal viewshed \nconcerns. Similar but coarser resource representation for PV results in a reduced resource \npotential scenario of 35.42 TW, compared with 95.9 TW in the default case. For other renewable \nenergy technologies (CSP, geothermal, hydropower, and biopower) technical potential is reduced \nby 50%. The reduction is applied uniformly across geography and resource classes (i.e., all \nregions and classes experience the same 50% reduction). \nTransmission Expansion \nAll scenarios except the high and low transmission scenarios allow the current transmission \nnetwork to be expanded. Expansion can only occur in regions that are currently connected by \ntransmission. \nThe high transmission availability sensitivity allows new high voltage direct current (HVDC) \ntransmission capacity to be built between any pair of regions that are connected by existing \ntransmission. HVDC transmission is assumed to have a loss rate of 0.5%/100 miles (as compared \nto 1%/100 miles for AC) and to use voltage source converters (VSC) with a 1% loss rate for \nAC/DC conversion. For additional descriptions of how the transmission networks are modeled, \nsee Section B.2 in the appendix of (Denholm et al. 2022).  \nRooftop PV Adoption \nThe Standard Scenarios rely on the dGen model to provide estimates of rooftop PV deployment \nover time. dGen produces projections for rooftop PV deployment over time using marginal \nelectricity costs from ReEDS. Only a subset of the Standard Scenarios have corresponding dGen \nruns (the Mid-case, Low RE Cost, High RE Cost, and No IRA scenarios). The dGen projections \nfor rooftop PV are used as exogenous inputs in the ReEDS model. ReEDS then projects the grid \nevolution through 2050, resulting in most of the outputs reported here. See Section 2.3 for a \ndiscussion of the interpretation of IRA’s provisions for distributed generation.  \nA.2 Changes from the 2021 Edition \nSince last year’s Standard Scenarios report (Cole et al. 2021), we have made the key modeling \nchanges in the ReEDS model that are summarized in Table A-8.",

The emissions metrics are calculated \nusing the fuel-specific emissions factors given in this section. The resulting emissions per \nmegawatt-hour of electric generation is a function of the generator’s heat rate (i.e., the rate at \nwhich fuel is converted into electricity), which can vary by generator. Heat rates for newly built \ngenerators generally follow the projections in NREL’s ATB. Heat rates for existing generators \ndraw from EIA data. The input data and logic driving the overall mixture of heat rates in ReEDS \ncan be viewed via the publicly available ReEDS repository.  \nEmissions factors for CO2, CH4, and N2O are national averages. SO2 and NOx emissions factors \nfor non-CCS gas, non-CCS coal, and oil are the average of state-level averages for those fuels \nfrom 2019 and 2020 eGRID data. The remaining SO2 and NOx emissions factors are national \naverages drawn from the ATB or prior ReEDS assumptions. There are no precombustion values \nfor SO\n2 or NOx. All reported emissions are derived from historical emissions intensities, which \nneglect how emissions may change in the future (e.g., increases in emissions intensities from \nmore variable generator operations or decreases in emissions intensities from improvements in \ncontrol technologies).  \nThe precombustion emission factors include fuel extraction, processing, and transport, including \nfugitive emissions. The precombustion emissions for natural gas are drawn from (Littlefield et al. \n2019). Power plants are assumed to avoid distribution losses, which results in a fugitive methane \nemissions rate of 1.08%.14 \nEmissions from ongoing, non-combustion activities (e.g., the emissions induced by operation and \nmaintenance activities) are not included in the emissions metrics. Emissions from commissioning \nor decommissioning generators or other physical infrastructure are also not included.  \nBioenergy with CCS is assumed to have a net combustion rate of negative 60.0 kg of CO\n2 per \nMMBtu of fuel (where the CO2 removal from feedstock growth and subsequent capture post-\ncombustion is combined into a single factor). The bioenergy with CCS values for precombustion \nactivities take the same values as the biomass category. Natural gas and coal generators with \ncarbon capture are assumed to have a 90% reduction in their CO2 from direct combustion.  \nSources indicated in Table A-9 are: \n• US LCI: U.S. Life Cycle Inventory Database (NREL 2021) \n• ReEDS 2021: Regional Energy Deployment System (ReEDS) Model Documentation: \nVersion 2020 (Ho et al. 2021) \n• EPA 2016: Greenhouse Gas Inventory Guidance: Direct Emissions from Stationary \nCombustion Sources (United States Environmental Protection Agency 2016) \n• ATB 2021: Annual Technology Baseline 2021 (NREL 2021)  \n• CARB 11-307: Assessment of the Emissions and Energy Impacts of Biomass and Biogas \nUse in California (Carreras-Sospedra et al. 2015). \n• NETL 2019: Life Cycle Analysis of Natural Gas Extraction and Power Generation \n(Littlefield et al. 2019) \n \n14 Assuming power plants avoid distribution losses was explicitly stated by Skone et al. in a predecessor publication \n(Skone et al. 2014).",

Review of Comments on Proposed \nRevisions to the Guides and Additional \nChanges to Proposed Guides Published \nin July 2022 \nMany of the comments received by \nthe Commission were generally \nsupportive of the proposed revisions.\n3 \nOne comment urged the FTC not to \nbacktrack in response to complaints \nfrom certain commenters.\n4 One \ncomment said the Commission should \navoid making changes beyond updating \nexamples and providing minor \nclarifications,\n5 but the commenter only \nraised concerns about a few specific \nissues.\n6 Another comment said the \nCommission should not use the Guides \nto communicate the policy interests of \nthe Commission\n7 and disagreed with \nmany of the proposed changes.8 Other \ncommenters supported or opposed \ndiscrete revisions or asked for \nadditional changes, guidance, or \nenforcement, but did not comment upon \nthe proposed changes generally.\n9 \nWhat follows is a section-by-section \ndiscussion of comments received, the \nCommission’s reactions to the \ncomments, and any resulting changes to \nthe Guides. The discussion also notes \nadditional changes not prompted by the \ncomments but does not flag non- \nsubstantive edits intended merely to \nimprove the readability of the examples. \nA. Section 255.0 Purpose and \nDefinitions \n1. The Significance of the Examples \nOne commenter assumed significance \nwhen an example did not address other \npossible issues that might arise from the \nfacts described.\n10 The Commission is \nadding a statement to § 255.0(a) noting \nthat the examples in each section of the \nGuides apply the principles of that \nsection to particular factual scenarios, \nbut they do not address every possible \nissue the facts or principles might \nimplicate. \n2. Definitions of ‘‘Endorsements’’ and \n‘‘Endorsers’’ \nThe Commission proposed revising \nthe definition of an ‘‘endorsement’’ to \nmake clear that tags in social media \nposts can be endorsements. One \ncomment stated addressing tags is \nbeneficial\n11 and two comments \nasserted, correctly, that not all tags are \nendorsements,\n12 with one of them \nsaying the proposed language \ncommunicates otherwise.\n13 The \nCommission is therefore revising the \nlanguage of the definition to clarify that \ntags and certain other types of \ncommunications ‘‘can be’’ \nendorsements. Another commenter \nassumed the list was exhaustive and if \na type of message was not on the list, \nthe Commission did not consider it to \nbe an endorsement.\n14 To the contrary, \nthe list is illustrative and not \nexhaustive. \nThe Commission proposed revising \nthe definition of an ‘‘endorser’’ to \ninclude what ‘‘appear[s] to be an \nindividual, group, or institution.’’ Two \ncommenters said the proposed revised \ndefinition addressing fabricated \nendorsers is beneficial.\n15 A third \ncommenter asked that the Commission \nmake clear using express language or \nexamples that the revised definition \napplies to virtual endorsers or fabricated \nendorsers.\n16 A fourth commenter said \nthe new language was ambiguous and, \nif the Commission simply intended to \naddress virtual influencers, then it \nshould use language to specifically \naddress that concept.\n17 The Commission \ndoes not agree that the new definitional \nlanguage is ambiguous or addresses only \nvirtual influencers; rather, the new \nlanguage is intended to also encompass \nthe writers of fake reviews and non- \nexistent entities that purport to give \nendorsements. The Commission is \nadding a sentence to Example 12 stating \nthat fake positive reviews used to \npromote a product are ‘‘endorsements.’’ \nThe Commission is also deleting ‘‘or \nservice’’ from ‘‘product or service,’’ \nbecause the term ‘‘product’’ includes a \n‘‘service.’’\n18 \n2. Definition of ‘‘Product’’ \nThe Commission proposed including \na ‘‘brand’’ within the definition of a \n‘‘product.’’ Two commenters supported \nthe inclusion of ‘‘brands’’\n19 and another \ncommenter raised concerns its inclusion \nwould complicate whether a third-party \nreview platform should consider a \nreview to be a product review or a \nservice review.\n20 The addition of the \nword ‘‘brand’’ to the definition of \n‘‘product’’ is not intended to address or \nimpact how review platforms categorize \nreviews of brands. \n3. Definition of ‘‘Clear and \nConspicuous’’ \nThe Commission proposed adding a \ndefinition of ‘‘clear and conspicuous’’ to \ndescribe the characteristics necessary to \nmake disclosures effective. A number of \ncommenters supported the definition,\n21 \nwith one of them asking for flexibility \nin how the definition is applied.\n22 One \ncommenter asserted that requiring \nonline disclosures to be unavoidable is \nunlikely to benefit consumers,\n23 and \nanother one opposed the definition, \narguing for greater flexibility.\n24 Some \ncommenters asked for specific guidance \nabout compliant or non-compliant \ndisclosures,\n25 and one supported \naddressing general principles in the \nGuides and providing more detailed \nguidance in staff business guidance.\n26 \nThe Commission is adopting the \nproposed definition, which it believes is \nboth useful and flexible. For online \ndisclosures to be effective, they must be \nunavoidable. The Commission further \nbelieves its current approach to \nendorsement-related guidance makes \nsense, with the Guides focused on \ngeneral principles and examples, and \nthe more informal (and more frequently \nupdated) staff guidance focused on \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 17:11 Jul 25, 2023 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00063 Fmt 4700 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\26JYR1.SGM 26JYR1lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with RULES1",

Examples \nThe first example of § 255.0 involves \na film producer excerpting a film critic’s \nreview and placing it in an \nadvertisement. One commenter asserted \nthe excerpted statement is not an \nendorsement because there is no \nmaterial connection between the critic \nand the endorser.\n27 The Commission \ndisagrees: a statement can be an \nendorsement even absent a material \nconnection with the advertiser. The \nCommission is modifying the example \nto clarify that, while the critic’s review \nitself is not an endorsement, the excerpt \nused in the advertisement is an \nendorsement. \nExample 3 concerns a spokesperson \nwho does not purport to speak on the \nbasis of their own opinions and \ntherefore is not considered an endorser. \nAlthough no commenters addressed this \nexample, the Commission is clarifying \nthat the spokesperson also does not \npurport to speak from personal \nexperience. \nExample 4 discusses an ad for \nautomobile tires featuring a well-known \nprofessional automobile racing driver. \nGiven the driver’s expertise in \nautomotive products, the Commission \nbelieves many consumers would likely \nthink what the driver says about the \npositive attributes of the tires reflects \nthe driver’s personal views based on \nhaving personal knowledge about the \ntires. One commenter took issue with \nthe Commission’s revised language that \nconsumers would likely think the \ndriver’s statement was based upon \npersonal knowledge or experience.\n28 \nThe Commission disagrees with the \ncommenter. Many consumers would \nlikely think a professional racer would \nnot speak for a product within their \nfield of expertise without actually \nbelieving in those statements. The \nCommission is, however, further editing \nthe example to make it internally \nconsistent. \nThe Commission proposed adding an \nalternative scenario to Example 5 \ninvolving a golfer who was ‘‘hired’’ to \npost a video to social media of them \ndriving a particular brand of golf ball. \nOne commenter said the example was \nhelpful in demonstrating that images \ncan be endorsements.\n29 Another \ncommenter said not every social media \npost by a golfer showing golf balls is an \nendorsement and the Commission \nshould make it clearer that it is an \nendorsement because the golfer was \nhired.\n30 Although the Commission \nbelieves the example was clear as \nwritten, it is making it even clearer by \ndescribing the social media post as a \n‘‘paid post.’’ \nExample 6 is about an actor who says \na home fitness system is ‘‘the most \neffective and easy-to-use home exercise \nmachine that I have ever tried.’’ One \ncommenter asserted this would only be \ndeceptive if the actor had not used the \nmachine.\n31 The example is intended to \nillustrate why this statement is an \nendorsement and is not intended to \naddress all the ways the statement could \nbe deceptive or who could be liable for \nany such deception. The Commission \nnotes, however, there are multiple ways \nin which the statement could be \ndeceptive, including not representing \nthe actor’s actual opinions or misleading \nconsumers as to the machine’s \neffectiveness or ease of use. \nExample 7 illustrates several \nscenarios in which a consumer’s \nexpressed views of a brand of dog food \nwould or would not be considered an \nendorsement. In the first scenario, a \nconsumer with no connection to the \nmanufacturer decides to buy the \nproduct and post about it or review it \nonline. The proposed revised example \nsaid certain statements by the consumer \nare not an endorsement. One commenter \nsuggested the Commission clarify that \nthe consumer purchased the product \nwith the consumer’s own money, and \nthe example now does so.\n32 Another \ncommenter asked whether the \nconsumer’s review would be an \nendorsement if the manufacturer \nhighlighted the review on its \nhomepage.\n33 The Commission is adding \na sentence to the example stating that a \nfeatured review would be considered an \nendorsement. The Commission is also \ndeleting a statement about whether the \nconsumer’s review would otherwise be \nan endorsement if posted on a \nmanufacturer’s or retailer’s website. \nSuch a conclusion may depend on \nspecific legal and factual issues. \nExample 7 includes an alternative \nscenario in which the consumer \nparticipates in a marketing program in \nwhich participants agree to periodically \nreceive free products from various \nmanufacturers and can write reviews if \nthey want to do so. One commenter \nsupported the example,\n34 and two \nothers questioned whether the reviews \nare endorsements given that they are \nentirely optional.\n35 To clarify this issue, \nthe Commission is making two changes. \nFirst, it is modifying the example to \nstate the participants had agreed to \nwrite reviews of the free products and \nthe reviews were therefore \nendorsements. Second, the Commission \nis adding a second alternative scenario \nin which an influencer receives a \nvaluable, unsolicited product and is \nasked, but not required, to endorse the \nproduct. The Commission believes any \nresulting posts would be endorsements \neven though the influencer could have \nchosen not to endorse the product. \nOne commenter indicated support for \nproposed new Examples 8 through 11.\n36 \nProposed Example 8 explains a video \ngame influencer who is paid to play and \nlive stream a game is implicitly \nendorsing the game by appearing to \nenjoy playing it. One commenter could \nnot understand why the player’s \nenjoyment is relevant.\n37 The \nCommission is modifying the example \nto clarify that the player’s apparent \nenjoyment is implicitly a \nrecommendation. \nTo illustrate disclosures that are not \nclear and conspicuous, the Commission \nproposed adding Example 9, which \ncontains several paragraphs. Paragraph \n(ii) involves an influencer disclosing \ntheir connection to a manufacturer in \nsocial media posts written such that \nconsumers have to click on a link \nlabeled ‘‘more’’ in order to see the \ndisclosure. The example is based on the \nCommission’s case against Teami, LLC, \nand its owners.\n38 Two commenters \nsupported the example 39 and a third \nasked the Commission to explain why \nthe disclosure is unlikely to be noticed, \nread, or understood.\n40 The Commission \nis clarifying the example by stating that, \nif the endorsement is visible without \nhaving to click on the link labeled \n‘‘more,’’ but the disclosure is not visible \nwithout the viewer doing so, then the \ndisclosure is not unavoidable and thus \nis not clear and conspicuous. \nProposed Example 10 posits that, \nwhen an ad is targeted to older \nconsumers, whether the disclosure is \nclear and conspicuous will be evaluated \nfrom the perspective of older \nconsumers, including those with \ndiminished auditory, visual, or \ncognitive processing abilities.

See BBB \nNational Programs at 6–7. The Commission does \nnot agree. Even when a person is talking about their \nown experience using a product or service, they \ncould face liability for deceptive claims under \nsection 5 based on being the advertiser, providing \nthe means and instrumentalities to deceive, or other \ntheories. And a principal is liable for its agents’ \nviolations. \n51 AOA at 2, Consumer Reports at 8. \n52 ANA at 7. \n53 RILA at 4–5. \n54 N/MA at 4. \n55 ESA at 3. \n56 BBB National Programs at 6–7. \ncommenter, asserting the example is \npremised on unfair, insulting, and \nprejudicial assumptions about older \nadults and their abilities to understand \nads, asked that the example be \nwithdrawn.\n41 The example does not \nassume older adults necessarily have \ndiminished capacities, but it is \nreasonable to assume that population \nincludes such individuals. The \nCommission’s Deception Policy \nStatement recognizes that when \n‘‘representations . . . are targeted to a \nspecific audience . . . the Commission \ndetermines the effect of the practice on \na reasonable member of that group.’’\n42 \nProposed Example 11 is intended to \nshow how the definition of ‘‘clear and \nconspicuous’’ could apply to an \nadvertisement microtargeted to a very \ndiscrete population. It imagines an \nadvertisement for a cholesterol-lowering \nproduct that requires a disclosure \nbecause it contains testimonials about \nresults that greatly exceed those \ngenerally experienced by the product’s \nusers. Based on online data collection, \nthe ad is microtargeted to Spanish- \nspeaking individuals who have high \ncholesterol levels and are unable to \nunderstand English. While the ad is in \nSpanish, the disclosure is only in \nEnglish. One commenter expressed the \nview that the example was offensive and \npremised on inaccurate assumptions \nthat a Spanish-speaking audience might \nbe likely to have high cholesterol.\n43 The \nexample is not based upon such an \nassumption but is instead an illustration \nof when a disclosure is needed and how \nthat disclosure must be in a language \nthe target audience will understand. The \nexample referenced Spanish speakers \nbecause Spanish is the second-most \nspoken language in the United States. \nThe Commission is revising the example \nto make it more generically about \nspeakers of a ‘‘particular language . . . \nwho are unable to understand English.’’ \nThe Commission is also adding a \nstatement that the disclosure must be in \nthe same language as the ad. \nProposed Example 12 addresses fake \nnegative reviews of a competitor’s \nproduct. Three commenters supported \nthe example,\n44 with one asking the \nCommission to state that commissioning \na fake positive review is an unfair trade \npractice.\n45 As discussed above, the \nCommission is adding a statement that \nfake positive reviews used to promote a \nproduct are endorsements. The \nCommission is also adding a cross- \nreference to an example in § 255.2 \ninvolving a manufacturer deceptively \nprocuring a fake positive consumer \nreview for its own product and having \nit published on a third-party review \nwebsite. \nProposed Example 13 says it is a \ndeceptive practice for users of social \nmedia platforms to purchase or create \nindicators of social media influence and \nthen use the indicators to misrepresent \nsuch influence for a commercial \npurpose. One commenter indicated \nsupport for the example.\n46 Another \ncommenter asserted the purchase or \ncreation of fake followers is inherently \na misrepresentation and should be \nprohibited per se.\n47 Although the use of \nfake followers may be inherently \n‘‘misleading’’ as that term is colloquially \nused, the Commission’s jurisdiction is \nlimited to commercial speech and does \nnot reach the use of fake followers for \nvanity or other non-commercial \npurposes. A third commenter was \nconcerned the example suggested that \nthe Commission would hold ad agencies \nliable when they recommend an \ninfluencer who, unbeknownst to the \nagencies, happens to be using fake \nindicators of social media influence.\n48 \nNothing in the Guides addresses \nholding ad agencies liable for merely \nrecommending such an influencer. \nB. Section 255.1 General \nConsiderations \n1. Quotation of Endorsers \nAs revised, proposed § 255.1(b) stated \nthat an advertisement need not present \nan endorser’s message in the exact \nwords of the endorser unless the ad \npresents the endorsement as a \nquotation. One commenter said the \nreference to a ‘‘quotation’’ is \nconfusing.\n49 The Commission is \nmodifying the example to say an ad \nmust use an endorser’s exact words only \nwhen the ad represents that it is \npresenting the endorser’s exact words, \nsuch as by using quotation marks. \n2. Liability of Advertisers \nSection 255.1.(d) addresses the \npotential liability of advertisers. Among \nother things, the proposed revised \nsubsection stated advertisers are subject \nto liability for misleading or \nunsubstantiated statements made \nthrough endorsements when there is a \nconnection between the advertiser and \nthe endorser.\n50 Two commenters said \nthey supported the proposed revised \nsubsection.51 Another commenter stated \nthe reference to ‘‘when there is a \nconnection between the advertiser and \nthe endorser’’ is unnecessary because \nthere has to be a sponsoring advertiser \nfor there to be an endorsement.\n52 The \nCommission is deleting that language \nbecause, as defined, an endorsement has \nto be an advertising, marketing, or \npromotional message. It is not correct, \nhowever, that a connection is needed for \nan advertiser to be liable for an \nendorsement. If, for example, an \nadvertiser retweets a positive statement \nby an unrelated third party or \nrepublishes in an advertisement a \npositive review by an unrelated third \nparty, that statement or review becomes \nan endorsement for which an advertiser \nis liable, despite the lack of any such \nconnection. \nOne commenter asserted it is \nunreasonable to hold an advertiser \nliable for what endorsers say unless the \nendorsers had a contractual relationship \nto the advertiser and the advertiser \neither: (1) failed to properly instruct \nendorsers and take action when it \nbecame aware of failures to comply or \n(2) instructed the endorsers to make a \nfalse claim.\n53 Another commenter said \nexpecting advertisers to monitor their \nendorsers is unreasonable and \nunnecessary.\n54 The Commission \ndisagrees with both commenters and \nexpects advertisers to be responsible for \nand monitor the actions of their \nendorsers. A different commenter asked \nthe Commission to continue to allow \nflexibility in monitoring such as FTC \nstaff business guidance currently \nprovides,\n55 and yet another commenter \nasked for more detailed guidance on \neffective oversight mechanisms.\n56 Such \ndetailed guidance is beyond the scope of \nthese Guides but may be addressed in \nstaff business guidance. The \nCommission is also changing a \nstatement in the subsection that an \nadvertiser may be liable ‘‘for an \nendorser’s deceptive statement’’ even \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 17:11 Jul 25, 2023 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00065 Fmt 4700 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\26JYR1.SGM 26JYR1lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with RULES1",

Four commenters \nsupported the proposed paragraph as \nwritten,\n59 and another commenter \nsuggested specifically identifying \nreview brokers as potentially liable.\n60 A \ndifferent commenter stated that the \nundefined term ‘‘intermediaries’’ could \nsweep in entities for which there is no \nagency relationship, privity, or \nparticipation in the misconduct.\n61 To \naddress this concern, the Commission is \nchanging the language of the provision \nto refer to the specific entities that it \nintends to address (i.e., advertising \nagencies, public relations firms, review \nbrokers, reputation management \ncompanies, and ‘‘other similar \nintermediaries’’). The Commission is \nalso revising the paragraph to state that \nsuch entities may also be liable for their \nroles in ‘‘creating’’ ads containing \nendorsements that they know or should \nknow are deceptive. Another comment \nsaid that the Commission should not \nseek to hold liable ‘‘an entity [that] \nmerely provides production services but \nis not involved in developing content \nfor an advertisement and does not have \ndirect knowledge about the accuracy of \nstatements in an endorsement or \ntestimonial.’’\n62 The Commission does \nnot believe that entities that merely \nprovide such production services are \n‘‘other similar intermediaries’’ as \ndescribed in the revised language. \n5. Misuse of Images of Endorsers \nProposed new § 255.1.(g) says that the \nuse of an endorsement with the image \nor likeness of a person other than the \nactual endorser is deceptive if it \nmisrepresents an attribute of the \nendorser that would be material to \nconsumers in the context of the \nendorsement, e.g., an endorser’s \ncomplexion in the context of an ad for \nan acne treatment. Three commenters \nsupported this new paragraph.\n63 \n6. Examples \nExample 1 of § 255.1 addresses \nwhether an endorsement is still valid \nafter a product has been reformulated. \nThe Commission is making minor \nmodifications to clarify the first subpart \nof the example. A proposed new second \nsubpart addressed an endorsement in a \nsocial media post. It said that even if an \nendorser would no longer use or \nrecommend a reformulated product, \nthere is no obligation for the endorser to \nmodify or delete a historic post as long \nas the date of the post is clear and \nconspicuous to viewers. One commenter \nsupported the example\n64 and another \nsaid that it is not clear from the example \nwhether the advertiser, as opposed to \nthe endorser, needs to change or delete \nhistorical posts.\n65 The Commission is \nmodifying the example to clarify that \nthe advertiser is not under any more \nobligation to do so than the endorser. \nThe proposed new subpart also \naddressed sharing or reposting of the \noriginal post after the product’s \nreformulation. The Commission is \nclarifying the example and adding that, \nunder such circumstances, the \nadvertiser would need to confirm that \nthe endorser holds the views expressed \nin the original post about the \nreformulated product. \nProposed new Example 2 involves an \nad featuring a well-known DJ who \nimplicitly communicates owning and \nregularly using an advertised coffee \nmaker, but who only used it during a \ndemonstration by the product’s \nmanufacturer. One commenter said that \nthe example described was not clearly \nan ad.\n66 The Commission is modifying \nthe example to clarify that the DJ is \nspeaking during a radio advertisement \nplayed during commercial breaks. \nAnother commenter asked the \nCommission to consider clarifying that \nthe DJ could have used the coffeemaker \nevery weekday at the studio and that the \nendorsement could have made the \ncontext of such use clear and \nunderstandable.\n67 The commenter is \ncorrect in that the DJ might have used \nthe coffee maker regularly without \nowning it. The Commission is \nsimplifying the example, focusing on \nthe implied claim of regular use, and \ndeleting the reference to ownership. \nExample 5 addresses the potential \nliability of an influencer for making an \nunsubstantiated health claim, as well as \nthe advertiser’s potential liability for the \ninfluencer’s endorsement. The \nCommission disagrees with a \ncommenter who asserted the proposed \nrevised example is too complicated and \nshould not address potential liability.\n68 \nProposed new Example 6 addresses \ntwo alternative scenarios in which the \npictures accompanying endorsements \nfeatured on a marketer’s website are not \nof the actual endorsers and misrepresent \nmaterial attributes of the endorsers. Two \ncommenters supported the example.\n69 \nThe Commission is clarifying in the first \nalternative that the pictures \naccompanying acne treatment \ntestimonials were ‘‘stock photos . . . \npurchased’’ by the advertiser. The \nsecond alternative involves a \ntestimonialist who says they lost 50 \npounds using a weight-loss product. \nThe subpart explains the testimonial on \nthe marketer’s website was \naccompanied by an ‘‘after’’ picture of a \nperson who appears to weigh 100 \npounds but the testimonial was from \nsomeone who weighed 250 pounds after \nthe weight loss. One commenter sought \nto correct a statement about the endorser \nappearing to have lost ‘‘one-third of \ntheir original body weight,’’ thinking the \nCommission had made a mathematical \nerror.\n70 The example was correct as \nwritten, but the Commission is adding \na parenthetical to the example \nexplaining its calculation. \nC. Section 255.2 Consumer \nEndorsements \n1. Substantiation for Performance \nClaims \nSection 255.2(a) says an advertiser \nmust possess and rely upon adequate \nsubstantiation, including, when \nappropriate, competent and reliable \nscientific evidence, to support claims \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 17:11 Jul 25, 2023 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00066 Fmt 4700 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\26JYR1.SGM 26JYR1lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with RULES1",

The \nCommission proposed clarifying this \nprinciple applies to both express and \nimplied claims. One commenter said \nthis clarification is helpful.\n71 \n2. Typicality Claims \nCurrently, § 255.2(b) says that, if an \nadvertiser does not have substantiation \nthat an endorser’s experience is \nrepresentative of what consumers will \ngenerally achieve, the advertisement \nshould clearly and conspicuously \ndisclose the generally expected \nperformance in the depicted \ncircumstances, and that the advertiser \nmust possess and rely on adequate \nsubstantiation for the representation in \nsuch disclosure. One commenter \nsupported this principle.\n72 The \nCommission proposed adding a \nsentence that the disclosure of the \ngenerally expected performance should \nbe presented in a manner that does not \nitself misrepresent what consumers can \nexpect. One commenter supported that \nposition.\n73 The Commission is also \nadding a sentence to the paragraph \nexplaining that, to be effective, a \ndisclosure must alter the net impression \nof an advertisement so it is not \nmisleading. \n3. Consumer Reviews \nThe Commission proposed adding a \nnew § 255.2(d) addressing advertisers \nprocuring, suppressing, boosting, \norganizing, or editing consumer reviews \nof their products or services in a way \nthat distorts or otherwise misrepresents \nwhat consumers think of their products. \nOne commenter asked whether this \nguidance covered upvoting, publishing, \nor selectively publishing reviews.\n74 The \nCommission is clarifying the new \nsubsection by adding publishing, \nupvoting, downvoting, and reporting. \nFour commenters supported the new \nparagraph.\n75 A different commenter said \nthe Commission was using the Guides \nin lieu of proper rulemaking in seeking \nto regulate the entire industry’s use of \ncustomer reviews.\n76 In the context of \nfour subsequent examples illustrating \nthe new principle, the same commenter \nstated the Commission was \nunnecessarily wading into an analysis of \nhow moderation of user-generated \nreviews may negate immunity otherwise \ngranted pursuant to section 230 of the \nCommunications Decency Act (the \n‘‘CDA’’), 47 U.S.C. 230, and the \nCommission’s guidance may lead to \ninconsistencies with ‘‘ongoing’’ legal \nprinciples.\n77 The commenter did not \nidentify any actual or purported \ninconsistencies between the \nCommission’s guidance and the CDA or \nother laws, and the Commission sees \nnone. The Commission reiterates that \nthe Guides are not regulations; as stated \nin § 255.0(a), the Guides are simply \n‘‘administrative interpretations of . . . \nsection 5 of the FTC Act’’ in order to \n‘‘provide the basis for voluntary \ncompliance.’’ The Commission need not \nengage in rulemaking to offer such \nguidance. \n4. Examples \nExample 2 of § 255.2 involves an ad \nfor a heat pump featuring three \ntestimonials about monetary savings \nthat will likely be interpreted as \nconveying such savings are \nrepresentative of what buyers can \ngenerally expect. The Commission \nproposed expanding the example to \nillustrate how disclosures of generally \nexpected results could themselves be \nmisleading if they apply only in limited \ncircumstances not described in the \nadvertisement. Two commenters \nsupported the inclusion of the \nadditional guidance.\n78 \nExample 4 addresses when an ad for \na weight-loss product 79 requires and \ndoes not require a disclosure of \ngenerally expected results and what \nsuch a disclosure should say. The \nCommission proposed revising the \nexample and expanding it from three to \nsix subparts. \nParagraph (ii) of Example 4 said that \nif a woman says, ‘‘I lost 50 pounds in \n6 months with WeightAway,’’ a \ndisclosure such as ‘‘Average weight loss \nis 1–2 pounds per week’’ is inadequate \nand likely deceptive. Although no \ncommenters addressed this subpart, the \nCommission is modifying this statement \nto better explain why such a disclosure \nis inadequate and likely deceptive. \nParagraph (iii) of Example 4 said a \ndisclosure such as ‘‘most women who \nuse WeightAway lose between 10 and \n50 pounds’’ is inadequate because the \nrange specified is so broad it does not \nsufficiently communicate what users \ncan generally expect. One commenter \nasked the Commission to state the \ndisclosure would be acceptable if the \ntop of the range (e.g., 50 pounds) had an \nappreciable number of incidences.\n80 \nThe Commission believes that, even if \nsome appreciable number of consumers \nlost 50 pounds, the range would still not \nadequately communicate what users can \ngenerally expect. A marketer could \ninstead disclose the generally expected \nresult and also state what percentage of \ncustomers lose 50 pounds or more. \nParagraph (iv) of Example 4 illustrates \nhow a disclosure of mean weight loss \ncould be deceptive when the mean is \nsubstantially affected by outliers. One \ncommenter said the new guidance was \nhelpful.\n81 Another commenter said it \nsupports ‘‘the allowance of ‘mean \ncomputation’ ’’;\n82 the Commission \ninterprets that comment to refer to the \nfact that disclosures could use mean \nweight loss in a non-deceptive way. \nParagraph (v) of Example 4 says that, \nif a manufacturer procures a fake review \nthat is published on a third-party review \nwebsite, the review is a deceptive \nendorsement because it was not written \nby a bona fide user of the product. The \nsubpart cross-references § 255.1(c). Two \ncommenters supported the inclusion of \nthis paragraph.\n83 The Commission is \nadding that the review would also be \ndeceptive because it does not reflect the \nhonest opinions, findings, beliefs, or \nexperience of the endorser, with a cross- \nreference to § 255.1(a). \nParagraph (vi) of Example 4 said the \ndisclosure ‘‘The typical weight loss of \nWeightAway users who stick with the \nprogram for 6 months is 35 pounds’’ is \ninadequate if only one-fifth of those \nwho start the weight-loss program stick \nwith it for six months. One commenter \nsupported the guidance\n84 while another \nasserted the disclosure was, in fact, \nadequate.\n85 The Commission continues \nto believe, as explained in the example, \nthe disclosure is inadequate because it \ndoes not communicate what the typical \noutcome is for users who start the \nprogram. \nOne commenter suggested the Guides \nspecifically state that selectively posting \nbona fide positive testimonials to third- \nparty review sites would constitute a \ndeceptive practice.\n86 The Commission is \nadding a paragraph (vii) to Example 4, \nsaying that if a manufacturer forwards \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 17:11 Jul 25, 2023 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00067 Fmt 4700 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\26JYR1.SGM 26JYR1lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with RULES1",

The example also \naddresses fact patterns in which the \nretailer blocks reviews containing \nprofanity or complaining about the \nowner’s policy positions. Based upon \nthe Consumer Review Fairness Act (the \n‘‘CRFA’’), 15 U.S.C. 45b, the example \nsays sellers are not required to display \ncustomer reviews that contain unlawful, \nharassing, abusive, obscene, vulgar, or \nsexually explicit content; content that is \ninappropriate with respect to race, \ngender, sexuality, or ethnicity; or \nreviews that the seller reasonably \nbelieves are fake, so long as a seller’s \ncriteria for not displaying such reviews \nare applied uniformly to all reviews \nsubmitted. The Commission also said \nsellers are not required to display \nreviews that are unrelated to their \nproducts or services, but customer \nservice is related to the seller’s products \nand services. One commenter suggested \nthe Commission expand the exceptions \nlisted to include other information that \nshould not be published, such as \nsensitive personal information.\n87 The \nCRFA also includes exceptions for \nreviews that ‘‘contain[] the personal \ninformation or likeness of another \nperson, or [are] libelous,’’\n88 content \n‘‘that is clearly false or misleading,’’89 \nor ‘‘trade secrets or privileged or \nconfidential commercial or financial \ninformation,’’\n90 and the Commission is \nadding that language to the example. \nAnother commenter said product \nreviews that are just about customer \nservice should not be displayed when \nthey are about the customer service of \na different seller.\n91 The Commission \nagrees and is modifying the example so \nit refers to ‘‘a particular seller’s \ncustomer service.’’ One commenter took \nthe view that all product reviews \nincluding those just about customer \nservices should be displayed to allow \nconsumers reading the reviews to \ndecide for themselves how to interpret \nthem,\n92 while another one said product \nreviews about services should not need \nto be published when there are other \nmechanisms for customer service \nfeedback.\n93 The Commission responds \nthat the purpose of publishing such \nreviews about customer service is to \nprotect and inform potential purchasers \nof the products, rather than simply to \nprovide a means for feedback. One \ncommenter agreed with the example, \nsaying that sellers should be able to \nelect not to display reviews that contain \nobjectionable content, as long as the \ncontent moderation is done without \nimproper consideration as to whether \nthe review is negative, neutral, or \npositive.\n94 The commenter also asked \nthat the right of third-party review \nplatforms to block similar content be \nnoted.\n95 The Commission agrees that \nthird-party review platforms should be \nable to similarly block such content, but \nit does not see the need to address the \nrights of third-party review platforms in \nthe Guides at this time. \nIn proposed new Example 10, a \nmanufacturer uses unfair threats of legal \naction or physical threats to coerce \nconsumers into deleting negative \nreviews of its products which the \nconsumers had posted on third-party \nreview websites. One commenter \nsupports the example and would \nexpand it beyond violence or litigation \nto other less drastic coercive \nmeasures.\n96 The Commission is \nexpanding the example to add threats to \ndisclose embarrassing information. The \nCommission also notes the listed threats \nare intended as illustrative and not \nexhaustive. Another commenter \nexpressed concerns that simply sending \na letter attempting to correct false \nstatements could be considered \nthreatening.\n97 The Commission would \nnot consider simply notifying a reviewer \nof inaccuracies to be threatening. The \nCommission is also modifying the \nexample to describe the circumstances \nin which threatened legal action would \nbe considered unfair or deceptive. A \nthird commenter suggested the \nCommission is improperly trying to \nexpand the CRFA through a Guide- \nrefreshing process when it should ask \nCongress to do so and said the \nCommission has not placed into the \nrecord any evidence that advertisers are \nfrequently threatening reviewers.\n98 The \nCommission is not attempting to expand \nthe CRFA. It is interpreting section 5 of \nthe FTC Act. Any enforcement actions \nbased upon conduct inconsistent with \nthe Guides would have to establish that \nthe conduct violated section 5. The \nCommission need not establish that an \naction is prevalent in order to give \nguidance that it believes the action is \nunfair. The example is based upon \nCommission cases against Roca Labs \nand World Patent Marketing.\n99 Finally, \nthe Commission is clarifying how the \nuse of such threats can be deceptive or \nunfair. \nAlthough it was not addressed by the \ncommenters, the Commission is adding \nan alternative scenario to Example 10 \nbased upon the facts of a recent \nCommission case.\n100 The new scenario \ninvolves a business abusing a third- \nparty review platform’s mechanism for \nreporting suspected fake reviews. A \nmanufacturer routinely flags negative \nreviews of its products as fake without \na reasonable basis for believing they are \nfake, which results in many truthful \nreviews being removed from the \nwebsite. Such conduct is an unfair or \ndeceptive practice. \nProposed new Example 11 addresses \na marketer engaging in review gating, \nwhich involves asking past purchasers \nto provide feedback on a product and \nthen inviting only those who give \npositive feedback to post online reviews \non one or more websites. The example \nnotes that the practice ‘‘may be unfair or \ndeceptive if it results in the posted \nreviews being substantially more \npositive than if the marketer had not \nengaged in the practice.’’ Two \ncommenters said that the example was \nhelpful,\n101 another suggested expanding \nit to address upvoting, downvoting, and \nselective publication,\n102 and a third said \nthat the Commission is unlawfully \nprohibiting advertisers from exercising \ntheir commercial speech rights by \nencouraging a happy customer to write \na review.\n103 The Commission added \npublishing, upvoting, downvoting, and \nreporting to the general principle \nexpressed in § 255.2(d) and does not \nbelieve it needs to add them to this \nexample. The Commission is not saying \nor suggesting that businesses cannot ask \nhappy customers for reviews. As the \nexample expressly states, the marketer \ncould have simply invited all recent \npurchasers to post reviews, even if it \nhad expressed its hope that the reviews \nwould be positive. The example also \nstates clearly that deception or \nunfairness occurs not in the selective \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 17:11 Jul 25, 2023 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00068 Fmt 4700 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\26JYR1.SGM 26JYR1lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with RULES1",

Section 255.3 Expert Endorsements \n1. An Exercise of Expertise \nThe proposed revision of § 255.3(b) \nsaid that an expert endorsement must be \nsupported by an actual exercise of the \nexpertise in evaluating product features \nor characteristics ‘‘with respect to which \nthe endorser has expertise.’’ In the \ncontext of Example 6 of § 255.3, two \ncommenters suggested more clearly \naddressing an expert’s purported \nexpertise—that is, the level of expertise \nthat an endorser is represented as \npossessing.\n104 The Commission is \nmodifying § 255.3(b) to make clear that \nthe endorser must have exercised the \nexpertise that they are ‘‘represented’’ as \npossessing.\n105 \n2. Examples \nExample 2 of § 255.3 describes an \nendorser of a hearing aid who is simply \nreferred to as a ‘‘doctor’’ during an ad. \nThe example says the ad likely implies \nthe endorser is a medical doctor with \nsubstantial experience in the area of \nhearing. As revised, the proposed \nexample would have said a non-medical \n‘‘doctor’’ (e.g., an individual with a \nPh.D. in audiology) or a physician \nwithout substantial experience in the \narea of hearing might be able to endorse \nthe product, but at a minimum, the \nadvertisement must make clear the \nnature and limits of the endorser’s \nexpertise. Two comments supported the \nproposed revised example,\n106 two \ncomments asked the Commission to \nclarify it is acceptable to describe an \naudiologist with a doctorate as ‘‘Doctor \nof Audiology,’’ ‘‘Au.D., Audiologist’’ or \n‘‘Ph.D., Audiologist,’’\n107 and one \ncomment asked why a doctor who \nclearly and conspicuously discloses the \nnature and limits of their expertise \nmight not be able to endorse a \nproduct.\n108 On reflection, the \nCommission recognizes that, in the \nabsence of a white coat, a stethoscope, \nor other indicia of an endorser being a \nphysician, consumers are likely to \nbelieve an endorser identified as a \ndoctor has expertise in the area of \nhearing but might not expect the doctor \nto be a medical doctor. The Commission \nis revising the example such that either \na medical doctor with substantial \nexperience in audiology or a non- \nmedical doctor with a Ph.D. or Au.D. in \naudiology could endorse the hearing aid \nas a ‘‘doctor’’ without any disclosure. \nFinally, the example will say a doctor \nwithout substantial experience in the \narea of hearing might be able to endorse \nthe product if the ad clearly and \nconspicuously discloses the nature and \nlimits of the endorser’s expertise. Given \nthe revision to the example, it is no \nlonger necessary to address how a \nperson with a doctorate in audiology \nshould be identified. The example \ncontinues to say the doctor without \nsubstantial experience in the area of \nhearing might be able to endorse the \nproduct as a doctor if the advertisement \nclearly and conspicuously discloses the \nnature and limits of the endorser’s \nexpertise. \nExample 3 refers to testing an \nautomobile part’s ‘‘efficacy,’’ which the \nCommission is changing to testing the \npart’s ‘‘performance.’’ \nE. Section 255.4 Endorsements by \nOrganizations \nSection 255.4 addresses endorsements \nby organizations. The Commission \nproposed adding two new examples to \nthis section. \nProposed new Example 2 describes a \ntrampoline manufacturer that sets up \nand operates what appears to be an \nindependent trampoline review website \nthat reviews the manufacturer’s \ntrampolines, as well as those of \ncompeting manufacturers. The example \nsays the claim of independence is false. \nThree commenters supported the \nexample.\n109 One commenter asked why \nthe example is in the ‘‘organizations’’ \nsection of the Guides, rather than the \nmaterial connections section.\n110 The \nCommission is rewording the example \nso the operator of the website appears to \nbe an independent trampoline institute. \nProposed new Example 3 involves a \nreview website operator that accepts \nmoney from manufacturers in exchange \nfor higher rankings of their products. \nThe example says a manufacturer who \npays for a higher ranking on the website \nmay be held liable for deception. Two \ncommenters supported the example.\n111 \nOne of them suggested the Commission \nclarify that both the manufacturer who \npays for a higher ranking and the site \noperator can be liable for misleading \nconsumers and the Commission say that \nusing a ranking methodology that \nresults in higher rankings for products \nor services with a relationship to the \nrating site is misleading.\n112 The \nCommission is making both of those \nchanges. One commenter said it was \nunclear how the example related to the \nGuides.\n113 The example belongs in the \nGuides because the review website is \nendorsing the products it is reviewing. \nF. Section 255.5 Disclosure of Material \nConnections \n1. Whether Connections Are Material \nSection 255.5 addresses the need to \ndisclose unexpected material \nconnections between the endorser and \nseller of an advertised product. To be \nmaterial, a connection must affect the \nweight or credibility the audience gives \nto the endorsement. The revised section \ngives examples of possible material \nconnections. One commenter agreed \nwith the general principle, as well as the \nspecific examples described,\n114 while \nanother supported the broad scope of \npossible material connections addressed \nin the section.\n115 Another commenter \nasked the Commission to add more \nexamples of benefits to an endorser that \nare or could be material.\n116 The \nexamples of possible material \nconnections listed in § 255.5 are meant \nto be illustrative rather than exhaustive, \nand the Commission does not believe it \nis necessary to expand the list. \nAs proposed, the revised section \nwould also acknowledge some \nconnections may be immaterial because \nthey are too insignificant to affect the \nweight or credibility the audience gives \nto endorsements. Two commenters \nasked for examples of connections that \nare immaterial. Whether a connection is \ntoo insignificant to be material is such \na fact-specific question that it is difficult \nto devise a useful example of a \nnecessarily immaterial connection. \n2. Whether Connections Are \nUnexpected \nThe most recent version of the Guides \ndescribes the type of connection that \nmust be disclosed as one that ‘‘is not \nreasonably expected by the audience.’’ \nThe Commission proposed restating this \nas ‘‘material connections do not need to \nbe disclosed when they are understood \nor expected by all but an insignificant \nportion of the audience for an \nendorsement.’’ The Commission is now \nrewording the statement in the Guides \nto say a ‘‘material connection needs to \nbe disclosed when a significant minority \nof the audience for an endorsement does \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 17:11 Jul 25, 2023 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00069 Fmt 4700 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\26JYR1.SGM 26JYR1lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with RULES1",

In addition, \nthe Commission is clarifying that the reference to \n‘‘more likely to expect’’ in that subpart means more \nlikely to expect than in a television commercial. \nnot understand or expect the \nconnection.’’ \nOne commenter asserted this \nguidance was ambiguous and asked that \nthe Commission give concrete examples \nor delete the new language.\n117 Two \nother commenters similarly asked for \nexamples.\n118 It may be that certain, \nwell-known influencers have become so \nclosely identified with a particular \nbrand that almost everyone knows of \ntheir connection. It may also be that \nfollowers of some well-known \ninfluencers have all come to expect that \nthe influencers endorse products only \nwhen paid. The Commission is reluctant \nto identify real-world influencers who \nmight fit these descriptions. Whether \nany particular connection is or is not \nexpected by an audience is a factual \nquestion that might require empirical \ntesting, and that testing might only be \nrelevant to a particular endorser or to a \nnarrow set of circumstances.\n119 \nAnother commenter stated consumers \nare more likely to understand and \nexpect that influencers have received \nsome sort of incentive when the \ninfluencers are reviewing or showcasing \ncertain types of products.\n120 The \ncommenter gave the example of video \ngame influencers and asserted many \nvideo game players are aware \ninfluencers have access to games before \nthose titles are made available to the \npublic. The Commission recognizes this \nassertion may be true, but an audience \nknowing generally about such early \naccess is not the same as knowing what \na given influencer may have received— \nwhether it’s merely early access or a \nlarge monetary payment—in connection \nwith a given game. \nTwo commenters were opposed to the \nproposed reworded principle.\n121 One \nsaid all connections should always be \ndisclosed and the Commission was \nweakening the Guides.\n122 The \nCommission disagrees. As discussed \nabove, the Guides already say the only \nconnections that must be disclosed are \nones not reasonably expected by the \naudience. If the audience does \nreasonably expect a connection, then it \nis not deceived by the lack of disclosure. \nConsistent with section 5 of the FTC \nAct, the Commission thus cannot \nrequire that every connection be \ndisclosed. This position is also \nconsistent with existing Example 2 of \n§ 255.5, which says that, if a film star \nendorses a particular food product in a \ntelevision commercial, a disclosure is \nunnecessary because it is ordinarily \nexpected that celebrities are paid for \nsuch appearances. \nThe other commenter who opposed \nthe revised guidance asked how one \ndetermines that a connection is \nunderstood by all but an insignificant \nportion of the audience.\n123 As discussed \nabove, the Commission has reworded its \nguidance in terms of a significant \nminority of the audience not \nunderstanding or expecting the \nconnection. Again, the question of \nwhether any particular connection is or \nis not expected by an audience is highly \nfact-specific and in some cases its \nresolution might require empirical \ntesting. The Guides do contain multiple \nexamples with scenarios in which the \nCommission is comfortable saying at \nleast a significant minority of the \naudience does not or is unlikely to \nunderstand or expect the connection. \nOne commenter asked the \nCommission to require marketers to \nsubstantiate that a material connection \nneed not be disclosed because it is \nunderstood or expected by the \naudience.\n124 In a section 5 case, the \nCommission has the burden of proving \na connection is material and is not able \nto shift the burden of proof to the \nmarketer. \n3. Details of Connections \nThe Commission proposed stating a \ndisclosure of a material connection does \nnot require the complete details of the \nconnection but must clearly \ncommunicate the nature of the \nconnection sufficiently for consumers to \nevaluate its significance. \nOne commenter said disclosures of \nmaterial connections should not require \nthe dollar amount of any payment\n125 \nand another supported not having to \ndisclose the details of a connection.\n126 \nAnother commenter said influencers \nshould disclose how much they are \nbeing paid because the ‘‘large scope and \nrange of differing pay might impact \nwhat products influencers are pushing \nto their audience.’’\n127 The Commission \nis not convinced consumers are \ngenerally misled by not knowing how \nmuch influencers are paid. \nA different commenter asked if the \nnew statement in the Guides meant a \ndisclosure like ‘‘#Ad’’ is now \ninsufficient.\n128 That is not the \nCommission’s intention. The \nCommission is adding a new example, \ndrawn from staff business guidance, to \nillustrate when a disclosure does not \nadequately communicate the nature of \nthe material connection. In new \nExample 13, an app developer gives a \nconsumer a 99-cent game app for free in \norder to review it. A disclosure that the \nconsumer was given the app for free \nsuggests the consumer did not receive \nanything else for the review, which \nwould be deceptive if the app developer \nalso gave the consumer $50 for the \nreview. \n4. Examples\n129 \nExample 3 of § 255.5 involves a \nprofessional tennis player who has a \ncontractual relationship with a laser \nvision correction clinic. The contract \nprovides for payment to the athlete for \nspeaking publicly about their vision \ncorrection surgery at the clinic. One \ncommenter suggested noting that, if the \nsurgery had been performed for free, \nand if consumers would not have \nexpected that to have been the case, the \nfree surgery is a material connection \nthat would require disclosure.\n130 The \nreceipt of free surgery is already \naddressed in what the Commission \nproposed as subpart 2 of the example. \nAs proposed, new paragraph (ii) of \nExample 3 began by stating the player \n‘‘also’’ touts the results of the surgery \n‘‘in a social media post.’’ It said the \nrelationship should be disclosed even if \nthe relationship involves no payments \nbut only the tennis player getting the \nlaser correction surgery for free or at ‘‘a \nreduced cost.’’ One commenter raised \nthree concerns with this subpart of the \nexample. It said the use of ‘‘also’’ rather \nthan ‘‘instead’’ might indicate the FTC \nintends that the hypothetical facts only \nin the aggregate produce the stated \noutcome.\n131 The Commission will \nchange ‘‘also’’ to ‘‘instead.’’132 The \ncommenter also asked the Commission \nto articulate more clearly why the use of \nthe tennis player’s endorsement on the \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 17:11 Jul 25, 2023 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00070 Fmt 4700 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\26JYR1.SGM 26JYR1lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with RULES1",

See supra n. 119. \n148 Consumer Reports at 10. \nclinic’s social media page would not \nreasonably be expected by the \naudience.\n133 The example is intended to \naddress a post by the tennis player and \nnot by the clinic, so the Commission is \nchanging ‘‘in a social media post’’ to ‘‘in \nthe player’s social media post.’’ An \nendorsement disseminated from the \nclinic’s social media account is \naddressed in the example’s third \nsubpart. Finally, the commenter asked \nwhether receipt of discounted products \nor services is always material or \nwhether there is a threshold level of \ndiscount that makes it material.\n134 A \ndiscount is not necessarily material, but \nthere is not a clear line between a \nmaterial discount and a non-material \none. The Commission is changing the \nexample so it refers to receiving the \nsurgery at ‘‘a significantly reduced \ncost.’’ \nAs proposed, new paragraph (iii) of \nExample 3 varies the example so that \nthe clinic disseminates the tennis \nplayer’s endorsement from its own \nsocial media account. One commenter \nasserted that, if the tennis player’s post \nalready has a disclosure, the clinic \nshould not have to add a disclosure.\n135 \nAnother commenter stated the \nCommission failed to articulate why the \naudience would not reasonably expect \nthe tennis player’s endorsement on the \nclinic’s social media page was \ncompensated.\n136 The commenter \ncontinued that, in many instances, an \nadvertiser’s use of a celebrity endorser \non its own social media should not need \na disclosure because one would expect \nthat the celebrity was paid to provide \nthe endorsement.\n137 The commenter \nsuggested (a) the example clarify that \nthe clinic is reposting or sharing the \ntennis player’s social media \nendorsement from the prior paragraph \nto the clinic’s social media, (b) the \nadvertiser needs to disclose the \nrelationship because the tennis player \ndid not clearly and conspicuously \ndisclose it in the first place, and (c) \ngiven the nature of the endorsement \n(i.e., a personally created statement from \nthe tennis player versus a television \ncommercial with an endorsement), and \nin the context of the clinic’s social \nmedia, the viewing audience would \nlikely not reasonably expect the tennis \nplayer is being compensated.\n138 The \nCommission is adopting most of these \ncommenters’ suggestions and clarifying \nthat the clinic’s post is a repost. As \nmodified, the example makes clear the \noriginal post either did not have a clear \nand conspicuous disclosure or had a \ndisclosure that is not clear and \nconspicuous in the repost. \nExample 5 involves a restaurant \nwhose patrons are informed they will be \ninterviewed by the advertiser as part of \na television promotion of its new ‘‘meat- \nalternative’’ burger. The example said \nthe advertisement should clearly and \nconspicuously inform viewers the \npatrons on screen knew in advance they \nmight appear in a television \nadvertisement ‘‘if they gave the burger a \ngood review.’’ One commenter said the \nCommission should remove the \nlanguage regarding appearance in a \ntelevision advertisement ‘‘if they gave \nthe burger a good review.’’\n139 The \nCommission agrees. The disclosure need \nnot mention giving the burger a good \nreview; it is implicit someone would \nknow they would appear on television \nonly if they gave the product a good \nreview. \nA new paragraph (ii) of Example 6 \naddresses incentivized reviews and says \nany review that fails to clearly and \nconspicuously disclose incentives \nprovided to that reviewer is likely \ndeceptive. Three commenters supported \nthis guidance.\n140 The example \ncontinues, noting that, even if adequate \ndisclosures appear in each incentivized \nreview, the practice could still be \ndeceptive if the solicited reviews \ncontain star ratings that are included in \nan average star rating for the product \nand if that inclusion materially \nincreases that average star rating. One \ncommenter did not disagree with the \nCommission’s position but noted that, \nin its experience, including incentivized \nratings generally does not materially \naffect a product’s average star rating; it \ndid acknowledge possible exceptions \n(for example, if the product has few \nreviews other than incentivized \nones).\n141 A second commenter said the \nCommission should not prohibit \nincluding incentivized reviews in the \naverage star ratings and argued the \nCommission did not have evidence of a \ndifference between aggregate star ratings \ncontaining and not containing \nincentivized reviews.\n142 The \nCommission is not saying incentivized \nreviews materially inflate average star \nratings; just that, if they do, then they \ncould be deceptive. A third commenter \nsuggested allowing the website operator \nto make a blanket disclosure regarding \nincentivized reviews.\n143 A fourth \ncommenter said prohibiting the \ninclusion of incentivized reviews (when \nincentives are provided fairly and are \nclearly and conspicuously disclosed) in \naggregate star ratings could hurt \ncompetition and, as a practical matter, \nit may be infeasible for many advertisers \nto discern and calculate the average star \nrating without incentivized reviews.\n144 \nThe Commission is adding a statement \nto the example, stating that, if such a \nmaterial increase occurs, the marketer \nlikely would need to provide a clear and \nconspicuous disclosure to people who \nsee the average star rating. \nAs rewritten, Example 7 discusses a \nwoodworking influencer who received \nan expensive, full-size lathe from its \nmanufacturer in the hope the influencer \nwould post about it. The influencer \nposts videos containing favorable \ncomments about the lathe. The example \nsaid, if a significant proportion of \nviewers are likely unaware the \ninfluencer received the lathe free of \ncharge, the woodworker should clearly \nand conspicuously disclose receiving it \nfor free. One commenter supported the \nguidance.\n145 A different commenter said \nad agencies are contracted to monitor \ncompliance for a contracted period of \ntime and should not be expected to \nconduct ‘‘indefinite monitoring for \ndecades.’’\n146 A third commenter said \nthe Commission missed an opportunity \nin the example to provide guidance on \nhow long the woodworker might need to \ncontinue to make a disclosure.\n147 The \nCommission recognizes a connection \nprobably becomes less material over \ntime but is not prepared to set a time \nframe that divides material from \nimmaterial, a distinction that likely \nvaries depending upon the scenario. \nThe Commission agrees an ad agency \nshould not have to monitor an \ninfluencer for decades based upon a \nsingle gift. A fourth commenter objected \nto the rewritten example, saying it had \nbeen weakened by adding language that \na disclosure was necessary only if a \nsignificant proportion of viewers are \nlikely unaware that the influencer \nreceived the lathe free of charge.\n148 The \nCommission disagrees it is weakening \nthe example.

It says the \nemployer described in the example can \nlimit its own liability for such \nendorsements by engaging in \nappropriate training of employees and, \nif the employer has directed such \nendorsements or otherwise has reason to \nknow about them, by monitoring them \nand taking other steps to ensure \ncompliance. One commenter asked \nwhether the guidance regarding \nemployees applies to all employers, \nincluding large retailers who don’t \nmanufacture the products they sell, and \nsaid it would be unreasonable to expect \nan employer to review posts by \nthousands or millions of employees.\n150 \nThe Commission notes the connection \nbetween a retailer and its employees \nmay be relevant to readers of the \nemployees’ reviews even when the \nreviews are of products the retailer sells \nbut did not manufacture. As explained \nin the example, an employer would not \nhave to monitor the reviews or other \nendorsements of employees unless the \nemployer solicits the endorsements or \notherwise has reason to know about \nthem. Another commenter asked the \nCommission to rewrite the last sentence \nof the example to demonstrate the \ndisclosure requirement does not change \ndepending on the platform.\n151 The \nCommission is adopting the \ncommenter’s proposed language. \nNew Example 10 says the use of an \nenvironmental seal of approval from a \nnon-profit, third-party association that \ncharges manufacturers a reasonable fee \nfor the evaluation of their products does \nnot necessitate a disclosure regarding \nthe fee. One commenter asked about the \nrelevance of the third party being a \n‘‘non-profit.’’\n152 The fact the certifying \nentity is a non-profit might make it less \nlikely the decision to award the seal of \ncertification was impacted by payment. \nThree other commenters appeared to \nsupport the example,\n153 and one of \nthem suggested additional examples \ninvolving third-party seals or awards.\n154 \nThe Commission is adding new \nExample 14 illustrating a scenario in \nwhich a testing company has a \nrelationship with the company that \ncommissions an analysis, such that a \ndisclosure of the relationship is \nnecessary. \nIn new Example 11, the Commission \ndiscusses a blogger who writes product \nreviews and receives ‘‘a small portion of \nthe sale’’ through paid affiliate links. \nThe example says the reviews should \nclearly and conspicuously disclose the \ncompensation. Two commenters \nsupported the example\n155 and a third \ncommenter said the Commission should \nnot state that the blogger receives a \n‘‘small’’ portion of the sale unless it \nclarifies whether it is trying to \ncommunicate something about the \nnature or quantity of the compensation \nfor purposes of finding ‘‘materiality.’’\n156 \nThe Commission is striking the word \n‘‘small’’ from the example. One of the \ncommenters supporting the example \nasked the Commission to distinguish \npaid affiliate links from a display ad for \na product appearing on the same page \nas an article reviewing the product.\n157 \nAlthough the Commission does not \nconsider a display ad appearing on the \nsame page as a review to be inherently \ndeceptive, it does not consider the issue \nsufficiently related to the example to \nadd it to the Guides. \nNew Example 12 involves a podcast \nhost beginning a podcast by reading \nwhat is obviously a commercial. The \nexample states the host need not make \na disclosure because, even without a \nstatement identifying the advertiser as a \nsponsor, listeners would likely still \nexpect the podcaster was compensated. \nFive commenters supported the \nexample.\n158 The example continues by \nstating the ad might communicate the \nhost is expressing their own views, in \nwhich case the host would need to hold \nthe views expressed. \nExample 12 also states that, if the host \nmentions the product in a social media \npost, the fact no disclosure was required \nin the podcast is not relevant to whether \none is needed in the post. One \ncommenter said whether a material \nconnection disclosure is required is a \nfact-specific analysis; the Commission \nagrees.\n159 \nG. Section 255.6 Endorsements \nDirected to Children \nNew § 255.6 says endorsements in \nadvertisements directed to children may \nbe of special concern because of the \ncharacter of the audience; practices that \nwould not ordinarily be questioned in \nads directed to adults might be \nquestioned when directed to children. \nThree comments supported this new \nsection,\n160 with one of them suggesting \nthe section be supplemented with \nspecific examples.\n161 One commenter \nsaid the section was inadequate,162 \nwhile another urged the Commission to \nissue guidance that addresses in greater \ndetail which techniques and practices \nare impermissible,\n163 and yet another \nasked the Commission to ban targeted \nand influencer advertising to children \nand teens.\n164 A different commenter \nwas concerned that ‘‘any new standards \nfor children may impose duplicative \nmaterial disclosure requirements for \nads’’ and suggested the Commission \ndefer to the Better Business Bureau’s \nChildren’s Advertising Review Unit \n(‘‘CARU’’).\n165 Finally, a commenter said \nthe new section does not add any \nincremental benefit within the context \nof the Guides and, when appropriate, \nthe Commission can provide additional \nguidance to marketers through other \navenues, such as a report and other \nbusiness guidance.\n166 \nThe Commission continues to believe \nnew § 255.6 is helpful in establishing a \ngeneral principle and does not impose \nduplicative requirements on marketers. \nThe types of specific guidance that \nappear to be desired involve the \nwording, appearance, and placement of \ndisclosures of material connection in \nvarious contexts.

Such \nstaff guidance addresses details not covered in these \nGuides and is updated periodically but is not \napproved by or binding upon the Commission. \n255.0 Purpose and definitions. \n255.1 General considerations. \n255.2 Consumer endorsements. \n255.3 Expert endorsements. \n255.4 Endorsements by organizations. \n255.5 Disclosure of material connections. \n255.6 Endorsements directed to children. \nAuthority: 38 Stat. 717, as amended; 15 \nU.S.C. 41–58. \n§ 255.0 Purpose and definitions. \n(a) The Guides in this part represent \nadministrative interpretations of laws \nenforced by the Federal Trade \nCommission for the guidance of the \npublic in conducting its affairs in \nconformity with legal requirements. \nSpecifically, the Guides address the \napplication of section 5 of the FTC Act, \n15 U.S.C. 45, to the use of endorsements \nand testimonials in advertising. The \nGuides provide the basis for voluntary \ncompliance with the law by advertisers \nand endorsers. Practices inconsistent \nwith these Guides may result in \ncorrective action by the Commission \nunder section 5 if, after investigation, \nthe Commission has reason to believe \nthat the practices fall within the scope \nof conduct declared unlawful by the \nstatute. The Guides set forth the general \nprinciples that the Commission will use \nin evaluating endorsements and \ntestimonials, together with examples \nillustrating the application of those \nprinciples. The examples in each \nsection apply the principles of that \nsection to particular factual scenarios \nbut do not address every possible issue \nthat the facts or principles might \nimplicate. Nor do the Guides purport to \ncover every possible use of \nendorsements in advertising.\n1 Whether \na particular endorsement or testimonial \nis deceptive will depend on the specific \nfactual circumstances of the \nadvertisement at issue. \n(b) For purposes of this part, an \n‘‘endorsement’’ means any advertising, \nmarketing, or promotional message for a \nproduct that consumers are likely to \nbelieve reflects the opinions, beliefs, \nfindings, or experiences of a party other \nthan the sponsoring advertiser, even if \nthe views expressed by that party are \nidentical to those of the sponsoring \nadvertiser. Verbal statements, tags in \nsocial media posts, demonstrations, \ndepictions of the name, signature, \nlikeness or other identifying personal \ncharacteristics of an individual, and the \nname or seal of an organization can be \nendorsements. The party whose \nopinions, beliefs, findings, or \nexperience the message appears to \nreflect will be called the ‘‘endorser’’ and \ncould be or appear to be an individual, \ngroup, or institution. \n(c) The Commission intends to treat \nendorsements and testimonials \nidentically in the context of its \nenforcement of the Federal Trade \nCommission Act and for purposes of \nthis part. The term endorsements is \ntherefore generally used hereinafter to \ncover both terms and situations. \n(d) For purposes of this part, the term \n‘‘product’’ includes any product, \nservice, brand, company, or industry. \n(e) For purposes of this part, an \n‘‘expert’’ is an individual, group, or \ninstitution possessing, as a result of \nexperience, study, or training, \nknowledge of a particular subject, which \nknowledge is superior to what ordinary \nindividuals generally acquire. \n(f) For purposes of this part, ‘‘clear \nand conspicuous’’ means that a \ndisclosure is difficult to miss (i.e., easily \nnoticeable) and easily understandable \nby ordinary consumers. If a \ncommunication’s representation \nnecessitating a disclosure is made \nthrough visual means, the disclosure \nshould be made in at least the \ncommunication’s visual portion; if the \nrepresentation is made through audible \nmeans, the disclosure should be made \nin at least the communication’s audible \nportion; and if the representation is \nmade through both visual and audible \nmeans, the disclosure should be made \nin the communication’s visual and \naudible portions. A disclosure presented \nsimultaneously in both the visual and \naudible portions of a communication is \nmore likely to be clear and conspicuous. \nA visual disclosure, by its size, contrast, \nlocation, the length of time it appears, \nand other characteristics, should stand \nout from any accompanying text or \nother visual elements so that it is easily \nnoticed, read, and understood. An \naudible disclosure should be delivered \nin a volume, speed, and cadence \nsufficient for ordinary consumers to \neasily hear and understand it. In any \ncommunication using an interactive \nelectronic medium, such as social media \nor the internet, the disclosure should be \nunavoidable. The disclosure should not \nbe contradicted or mitigated by, or \ninconsistent with, anything else in the \ncommunication. When an endorsement \ntargets a specific audience, such as older \nadults, ‘‘ordinary consumers’’ includes \nmembers of that group. \n(g) Examples: \n(1) Example 1. A film critic’s review \nof a movie is excerpted in an \nadvertisement placed by the film’s \nproducer. The critic’s review is not an \nendorsement, but when the excerpt from \nthe review is used in the producer’s \nadvertisement, the excerpt becomes an \nendorsement. Readers would view it as \na statement of the critic’s own opinions \nand not those of the producer. If the \nexcerpt alters or quotes from the text of \nthe review in a way that does not fairly \nreflect its substance, the advertisement \nwould be deceptive because it distorts \nthe endorser’s opinion. (See § 255.1(b)) \n(2) Example 2. A television \ncommercial depicts two unidentified \nshoppers in a supermarket buying a \nlaundry detergent. One comments to the \nother how clean the advertised brand \nmakes the shopper’s clothes. The other \nshopper then replies, ‘‘I will try it \nbecause I have not been fully satisfied \nwith my own brand.’’ This obviously \nfictional dramatization would not be an \nendorsement. \n(3) Example 3. In an advertisement for \na pain remedy, an announcer unfamiliar \nto consumers except as a spokesperson \nfor the advertising drug company \npraises the drug’s ability to deliver fast \nand lasting pain relief. The \nspokesperson does not purport to speak \nfrom personal experience, nor on the \nbasis of their own opinions, but rather \nin the place of and on behalf of the drug \ncompany. The announcer’s statements \nwould not be considered an \nendorsement. \n(4) Example 4. A manufacturer of \nautomobile tires hires a well-known \nprofessional automobile racing driver to \ndeliver its advertising message in \ntelevision commercials. In these \ncommercials, the driver speaks of the \nsmooth ride, strength, and long life of \nthe tires. Many consumers are likely to \nbelieve this message reflects the driver’s \npersonal views, even if the driver does \nnot say so, because consumers recognize \nthe speaker primarily as a racing driver \nand not merely as a product \nspokesperson. Accordingly, many \nconsumers would likely believe the \ndriver would not speak for an \nautomotive product without actually \nbelieving in the product and having \npersonal knowledge sufficient to form \nthe beliefs expressed. The likely \nattribution of these beliefs to the driver \nmakes this message an endorsement \nunder the Guides. \n(5) Example 5. (i) A television \nadvertisement for a brand of golf balls \nincludes a video of a prominent and \nwell-recognized professional golfer \npracticing numerous drives off the tee. \nThe video would be an endorsement \neven though the golfer makes no verbal \nstatement in the advertisement. \n(ii) The golfer is also hired to post the \nvideo to their social media account. The \npaid post is an endorsement if viewers \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 17:11 Jul 25, 2023 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00073 Fmt 4700 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\26JYR1.SGM 26JYR1lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with RULES1",

(i) An infomercial for \na home fitness system is hosted by a \nwell-known actor. During the \ninfomercial, the actor demonstrates the \nmachine and states, ‘‘This is the most \neffective and easy-to-use home exercise \nmachine that I have ever tried.’’ Even if \nthe actor is reading from a script, the \nstatement would be an endorsement, \nbecause consumers are likely to believe \nit reflects the actor’s personal views. \n(ii) Assume that, rather than speaking \nabout their experience with or opinion \nof the machine, the actor says that the \nmachine was designed by exercise \nphysiologists at a leading university, \nthat it isolates each of five major muscle \ngroups, and that it is meant to be used \nfor fifteen minutes a day. After \ndemonstrating various exercises using \nthe machine, the actor finally says how \nmuch the machine costs and how to \norder it. As the actor does not say or do \nanything during the infomercial that \nwould lead viewers to believe that the \nactor is expressing their own views \nabout the machine, there is no \nendorsement. \n(7) Example 7. (i) A consumer who \nregularly purchases a particular brand of \ndog food decides one day to purchase a \nnew, more expensive brand made by the \nsame manufacturer with their own \nmoney. The purchaser posts to their \nsocial media account that the change in \ndiet has made their dog’s fur noticeably \nsofter and shinier, and that in their \nopinion, the new dog food definitely is \nworth the extra money. Because the \nconsumer has no connection to the \nmanufacturer beyond being an ordinary \npurchaser, their message cannot be \nattributed to the manufacturer and the \npost would not be deemed an \nendorsement under the Guides. The \nsame would be true if the purchaser \nwrites a consumer product review on an \nindependent review website. But, if the \nconsumer submits the review to the \nreview section of the manufacturer’s \nwebsite and the manufacturer chooses \nto highlight the review on the homepage \nof its website, then the review as \nfeatured is an endorsement even though \nthere is no connection between the \nconsumer and the manufacturer. \n(ii) Assume that rather than purchase \nthe dog food with their own money, the \nconsumer receives it for free because the \nstore routinely tracks purchases and the \ndog food manufacturer arranged for the \nstore to provide a coupon for a free trial \nbag of its new brand to all purchasers \nof its existing brand. The manufacturer \ndoes not ask coupon recipients for \nproduct reviews and recipients likely \nwould not assume that the manufacturer \nexpects them to post reviews. The \nconsumer’s post would not be deemed \nan endorsement under the Guides \nbecause this unsolicited review cannot \nbe attributed to the manufacturer. \n(iii) Assume now that the consumer \njoins a marketing program under which \nparticipants agree to periodically \nreceive free products from various \nmanufacturers and write reviews of \nthem. If the consumer receives a free bag \nof the new dog food through this \nprogram, their positive review would be \nconsidered an endorsement under the \nGuides because of their connection to \nthe manufacturer through the marketing \nprogram. \n(iv) Assume that the consumer is the \nowner of a ‘‘dog influencer’’ (a dog with \na social media account and a large \nnumber of followers). If the \nmanufacturer sends the consumer \ncoupons for a year’s worth of dog food \nand asks the consumer to feature the \nbrand in their dog’s social media feed, \nany resulting posts that feature the \nbrand would be considered \nendorsements even though the owner \ncould have chosen not to endorse the \nproduct. \n(8) Example 8. A college student, who \nhas earned a reputation as an excellent \nvideo game player, live streams their \ngame play. The developer of a new \nvideo game pays the student to play and \nlive stream its new game. The student \nplays the game and appears to enjoy it. \nEven though the college student does \nnot expressly recommend the game, the \ngame play is considered an endorsement \nbecause the apparent enjoyment is \nimplicitly a recommendation. \n(9) Example 9. (i) An influencer who \nis paid to endorse a vitamin product in \ntheir social media posts discloses their \nconnection to the product’s \nmanufacturer only on the profile pages \nof their social media accounts. The \ndisclosure is not clear and conspicuous \nbecause people seeing their paid posts \ncould easily miss the disclosure. \n(ii) Assume now that the influencer \ndiscloses their connection to the \nmanufacturer but that, in order to see \nthe disclosures, consumers have to click \non a link in the posts labeled simply \n‘‘more.’’ If the endorsement is visible \nwithout having to click on the link \nlabeled ‘‘more,’’ but the disclosure is not \nvisible without doing so, then the \ndisclosure is not unavoidable and thus \nis not clear and conspicuous. \n(iii) Assume now that the influencer \nrelies solely upon a social media \nplatform’s built-in disclosure tool for \none of these posts. The disclosure \nappears in small white text, it is set \nagainst the light background of the \nimage that the influencer posted, it \ncompetes with unrelated text that the \ninfluencer superimposed on the image, \nand the post appears for only five \nseconds. The disclosure is easy to miss \nand thus not clear and conspicuous. \n(10) Example 10. A television \nadvertisement promotes a smartphone \napp that purportedly halts cognitive \ndecline. The ad presents multiple \nendorsements by older senior citizens \nwho are represented as actual \nconsumers who used the app. The \nadvertisement discloses via both audio \nand visual means that the persons \nfeatured are actors. Because the \nadvertisement is targeted at older \nconsumers, whether the disclosure is \nclear and conspicuous will be evaluated \nfrom the perspective of older \nconsumers, including those with \ndiminished auditory, visual, or \ncognitive processing abilities. \n(11) Example 11. (i) A social media \nadvertisement promoting a cholesterol- \nlowering product features a \ntestimonialist who says by how much \ntheir serum cholesterol went down. The \nclaimed reduction greatly exceeds what \nis typically experienced by users of the \nproduct and a disclosure of typical \nresults is required. The marketer has \nbeen able to identify from online data \ncollection individuals with high \ncholesterol levels who speak a \nparticular foreign language and are \nunable to understand English. It \nmicrotargets a foreign-language version \nof the ad to them, disclosing users’ \ntypical results only in English. The \nadequacy of the disclosure will be \nevaluated from the perspective of the \nmicrotargeted individuals, and the \ndisclosure must be in the same language \nas the ad. \n(ii) Assume now that the ad has a \ndisclosure that is clear and conspicuous \nwhen viewed on a computer browser \nbut that it is not clear and conspicuous \nwhen the ad is rendered on a \nsmartphone. Because some consumers \nwill view the ad on their smartphones, \nthe disclosure is inadequate. \n(12) Example 12. An exterminator \npurchases fake negative reviews of \ncompeting exterminators. A paid or \notherwise incentivized negative \nstatement about a competitor’s service is \nnot an endorsement, as that term is used \nin the Guides. Nevertheless, such \nstatements, e.g., a paid negative review \nof a competing product, can be \ndeceptive in violation of section 5. (See \n§ 255.2.(e)(4)(v) regarding the purchase \nof a fake positive review for a product.) \nFake positive reviews that are used to \npromote a product are ‘‘endorsements.’’ \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 17:11 Jul 25, 2023 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00074 Fmt 4700 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\26JYR1.SGM 26JYR1lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with RULES1",

    "page_content": "48105 Federal Register / Vol. 88, No. 142 / Wednesday, July 26, 2023 / Rules and Regulations \n(13) Example 13. A motivational \nspeaker buys fake social media \nfollowers to impress potential clients. \nThe use by endorsers of fake indicators \nof social media influence, such as fake \nsocial media followers, is not itself an \nendorsement issue. The Commission \nnotes, however, that it is a deceptive \npractice for users of social media \nplatforms to purchase or create \nindicators of social media influence and \nthen use them to misrepresent such \ninfluence to potential clients, \npurchasers, investors, partners, or \nemployees or to anyone else for a \ncommercial purpose. It is also a \ndeceptive practice to sell or distribute \nsuch indicators to such users. \n§ 255.1 General considerations. \n(a) Endorsements must reflect the \nhonest opinions, findings, beliefs, or \nexperience of the endorser. \nFurthermore, an endorsement may not \nconvey any express or implied \nrepresentation that would be deceptive \nif made directly by the advertiser. (See \n§ 255.2(a) and (b) regarding \nsubstantiation of representations \nconveyed by consumer endorsements.) \n(b) An advertisement need not present \nan endorser’s message in the exact \nwords of the endorser unless the \nadvertisement represents that it is \npresenting the endorser’s exact words, \nsuch as through the use of quotation \nmarks. However, the endorsement may \nnot be presented out of context or \nreworded so as to distort in any way the \nendorser’s opinion or experience with \nthe product. An advertiser may use an \nendorsement of an expert or celebrity \nonly so long as it has good reason to \nbelieve that the endorser continues to \nsubscribe to the views presented. An \nadvertiser may satisfy this obligation by \nsecuring the endorser’s views at \nreasonable intervals where \nreasonableness will be determined by \nsuch factors as new information about \nthe performance or effectiveness of the \nproduct, a material alteration in the \nproduct, changes in the performance of \ncompetitors’ products, and the \nadvertiser’s contract commitments. \n(c) When the advertisement represents \nthat the endorser uses the endorsed \nproduct, the endorser must have been a \nbona fide user of it at the time the \nendorsement was given. Additionally, \nthe advertiser may continue to run the \nadvertisement only so long as it has \ngood reason to believe that the endorser \nremains a bona fide user of the product. \n(See paragraph (b) of this section \nregarding the ‘‘good reason to believe’’ \nrequirement.) \n(d) Advertisers are subject to liability \nfor misleading or unsubstantiated \nstatements made through endorsements \nor for failing to disclose unexpected \nmaterial connections between \nthemselves and their endorsers. (See \n§ 255.5.) An advertiser may be liable for \na deceptive endorsement even when the \nendorser is not liable. Advertisers \nshould: \n(1) Provide guidance to their \nendorsers on the need to ensure that \ntheir statements are not misleading and \nto disclose unexpected material \nconnections; \n(2) Monitor their endorsers’ \ncompliance; and \n(3) Take action sufficient to remedy \nnon-compliance and prevent future non- \ncompliance. While not a safe harbor, \ngood faith and effective guidance, \nmonitoring, and remedial action should \nreduce the incidence of deceptive \nclaims and reduce an advertiser’s odds \nof facing a Commission enforcement \naction. \n(e) Endorsers may be liable for \nstatements made in the course of their \nendorsements, such as when an \nendorser makes a representation that the \nendorser knows or should know to be \ndeceptive, including when an endorser \nfalsely represents that they personally \nused a product. Also, an endorser who \nis not an expert may be liable for \nmisleading or unsubstantiated \nrepresentations regarding a product’s \nperformance or effectiveness, such as \nwhen the representations are \ninconsistent with the endorser’s \npersonal experience or were not made \nor approved by the advertiser and go \nbeyond the scope of the endorser’s \npersonal experience. (For the \nresponsibilities of an endorser who is an \nexpert, see § 255.3.) Endorsers may also \nbe liable for failing to disclose \nunexpected material connections \nbetween themselves and an advertiser, \nsuch as when an endorser creates and \ndisseminates endorsements without \nsuch disclosures. \n(f) Advertising agencies, public \nrelations firms, review brokers, \nreputation management companies, and \nother similar intermediaries may be \nliable for their roles in creating or \ndisseminating endorsements containing \nrepresentations that they know or \nshould know are deceptive. They may \nalso be liable for their roles with respect \nto endorsements that fail to disclose \nunexpected material connections, \nwhether by disseminating \nadvertisements without necessary \ndisclosures or by hiring and directing \nendorsers who fail to make necessary \ndisclosures. \n(g) The use of an endorsement with \nthe image or likeness of a person other \nthan the actual endorser is deceptive if \nit misrepresents a material attribute of \nthe endorser. \n(h) Examples: \n(1) Example 1. (i) A building \ncontractor states in an advertisement \ndisseminated by a paint manufacturer, \n‘‘I use XYZ exterior house paint because \nof its remarkable quick drying \nproperties and durability.’’ This \nendorsement must comply with the \npertinent requirements of § 255.3. \nSubsequently, the advertiser \nreformulates its paint to enable it to \ncover exterior surfaces with only one \ncoat. Prior to continued use of the \ncontractor’s endorsement, the advertiser \nmust contact the contractor in order to \ndetermine whether the contractor would \ncontinue to use the paint as \nreformulated and to subscribe to the \nviews presented previously. \n(ii) Assume that, before the \nreformulation, the contractor had posted \nan endorsement of the paint to their \nsocial media account. Even if the \ncontractor would not use or recommend \nthe reformulated paint, there is no \nobligation for the contractor or the \nmanufacturer to modify or delete a \nhistoric post containing the \nendorsement as long as the date of that \npost is clear and conspicuous to \nviewers. If the contractor reposts or the \nadvertiser shares the contractor’s \noriginal endorsement after the \nreformulation, consumers would expect \nthat the contractor holds the views \nexpressed in the original post with \nrespect to the reformulated product and \nthe advertiser would need to confirm \nthat with the contractor. \n(2) Example 2. In a radio \nadvertisement played during \ncommercial breaks, a well-known DJ \ntalks about how much they enjoy \nmaking coffee with a particular coffee \nmaker in the morning. The DJ’s \ncomments likely communicate that they \nregularly use the coffee maker. If, \ninstead, they used it only during a \ndemonstration by its manufacturer, the \nad would be deceptive. \n(3) Example 3. (i) A dermatologist is \na paid advisor to a pharmaceutical \ncompany and is asked by the company \nto post about its products on their \nprofessional social media account. The \ndermatologist posts that the company’s \nnewest acne treatment product is \n‘‘clinically proven’’ to work. Before \ngiving the endorsement, the \ndermatologist received a write-up of the \nclinical study in question, which \nindicates flaws in the design and \nconduct of the study that are so serious \nthat they preclude any conclusions \nabout the efficacy of the product. Given \ntheir medical expertise, the \ndermatologist should have recognized \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 17:11 Jul 25, 2023 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00075 Fmt 4700 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\26JYR1.SGM 26JYR1lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with RULES1",

The advertiser is \nalso liable for the misrepresentation \nmade through the endorsement. (See \n§ 255.3 regarding the product evaluation \nthat an expert endorser must conduct.) \nEven if the study was sufficient to \nestablish the product’s proven efficacy, \nthe pharmaceutical company and the \ndermatologist are both potentially liable \nif the endorser fails to disclose their \nrelationship to the company.

The expert’s \n‘‘clinically proven’’ to work claim \nwould be deceptive and the company \nwould be liable for the claim, but \nbecause the dermatologist did not have \na reason to know that the claim was \ndeceptive, the expert would not be \nliable. \n(4) Example 4. A well-known \ncelebrity appears in an infomercial for a \nhot air roaster that purportedly cooks a \nchicken perfectly in twenty minutes. \nDuring the shooting of the infomercial, \nthe celebrity watches five attempts to \ncook chickens using the roaster. In each \nattempt, the chicken is undercooked \nafter twenty minutes and requires forty- \nfive minutes of cooking time. In the \ncommercial, the celebrity places an \nuncooked chicken in the roaster. The \ncelebrity then takes from a second \nroaster what appears to be a perfectly \ncooked chicken, tastes the chicken, and \nsays that if you want perfect chicken \nevery time, in just twenty minutes, this \nis the product you need. A significant \npercentage of consumers are likely to \nbelieve the statement represents the \ncelebrity’s own view and experience \neven though the celebrity is reading \nfrom a script. Because the celebrity \nknows that their statement is untrue, the \nendorser is subject to liability. The \nadvertiser is also liable for \nmisrepresentations made through the \nendorsement. \n(5) Example 5. A skin care products \nadvertiser hires an influencer to \npromote its products on the influencer’s \nsocial media account. The advertiser \nrequests that the influencer try a new \nbody lotion and post a video review of \nit. The advertiser does not provide the \ninfluencer with any materials stating \nthat the lotion cures skin conditions and \nthe influencer does not ask the \nadvertiser if it does. However, believing \nthat the lotion cleared up their eczema, \nthe influencer says in their review, \n‘‘This lotion cures eczema. All of my \nfollowers suffering from eczema should \nuse it.’’ The influencer, who did not \nlimit their statements to their personal \nexperience using the product and did \nnot have a reasonable basis for their \nclaim that the lotion cures eczema, is \nsubject to liability for the misleading or \nunsubstantiated representation in the \nendorsement. If the advertiser lacked \nadequate substantiation for the implied \nclaims that the lotion cures eczema, it \nwould be liable regardless of the \nliability of the endorser. The influencer \nand the advertiser may also be liable if \nthe influencer fails to disclose clearly \nand conspicuously being paid for the \nendorsement. (See § 255.5.) In order to \nlimit its potential liability, the \nadvertiser should provide guidance to \nits influencers concerning the need to \nensure that statements they make are \ntruthful and substantiated and the need \nto disclose unexpected material \nconnections and take other steps to \ndiscourage or prevent non-compliance. \nThe advertiser should also monitor its \ninfluencers’ compliance and take steps \nnecessary to remove and halt the \ncontinued publication of deceptive \nrepresentations when they are \ndiscovered and to ensure the disclosure \nof unexpected material connections. \n(See paragraph (d) of this section and \n§ 255.5.) \n(6) Example 6. (i) The website for an \nacne treatment features accurate \ntestimonials of users who say that the \nproduct improved their acne quickly \nand with no side effects. Instead of \nusing images of the actual endorsers, the \nwebsite accompanies the testimonials \nwith stock photos the advertiser \npurchased of individuals with near \nperfect skin. The images misrepresent \nthe improvements to the endorsers’ \ncomplexions. \n(ii) The same website also sells QRS \nWeight-Loss shakes and features a \ntruthful testimonial from an individual \nwho says, ‘‘I lost 50 pounds by just \ndrinking the shakes.’’ Instead of \naccompanying the testimonial with a \npicture of the actual endorser, who went \nfrom 300 pounds to 250 pounds, the \nwebsite shows a picture of an individual \nwho appears to weigh about 100 \npounds. By suggesting that QRS Weight- \nLoss shakes caused the endorser to lose \none-third of their original body weight \n(going from 150 pounds to 100 pounds), \nthe image misrepresents the product’s \neffectiveness. Even if it is accompanied \nby a picture of the actual endorser, the \ntestimonial could still communicate a \ndeceptive typicality claim. \n(7) Example 7. A learn-to-read \nprogram disseminates a sponsored \nsocial media post by a parent saying that \nthe program helped their child learn to \nread. The picture accompanying the \npost is not of the endorser and their \nchild. The testimonial is from the parent \nof a 7-year-old, but the post shows an \nimage of a child who appears to be only \n4 years old. By suggesting that the \nprogram taught a 4-year-old to read, the \nimage misrepresents the effectiveness of \nthe program. \n§ 255.2 Consumer endorsements. \n(a) An advertisement employing \nendorsements by one or more \nconsumers about the performance of an \nadvertised product will be interpreted \nas representing that the product is \neffective for the purpose depicted in the \nadvertisement. Therefore, the advertiser \nmust possess and rely upon adequate \nsubstantiation, including, when \nappropriate, competent and reliable \nscientific evidence, to support express \nand implied claims made through \nendorsements in the same manner the \nadvertiser would be required to do if it \nhad made the representation directly, \ni.e., without using endorsements. \nConsumer endorsements themselves are \nnot competent and reliable scientific \nevidence. \n(b) An advertisement containing an \nendorsement relating the experience of \none or more consumers on a central or \nkey attribute of the product will likely \nbe interpreted as representing that the \nendorser’s experience is representative \nof what consumers will generally \nachieve with the advertised product in \nactual, albeit variable, conditions of use. \nTherefore, an advertiser should possess \nand rely upon adequate substantiation \nfor this representation. If the advertiser \ndoes not have substantiation that the \nendorser’s experience is representative \nof what consumers will generally \nachieve, the advertisement should \nclearly and conspicuously disclose the \ngenerally expected performance in the \ndepicted circumstances, and the \nadvertiser must possess and rely on \nadequate substantiation for that \nrepresentation. The disclosure of the \ngenerally expected performance should \nbe presented in a manner that does not \nitself misrepresent what consumers can \nexpect. To be effective, such disclosure \nmust alter the net impression of the \nadvertisement so that it is not \nmisleading. \n(c) Advertisements presenting \nendorsements by what are represented, \nexpressly or by implication, to be \n‘‘actual consumers’’ should utilize \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 17:11 Jul 25, 2023 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00076 Fmt 4700 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\26JYR1.SGM 26JYR1lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with RULES1",

(i) A web page for a \nbaldness treatment consists entirely of \ntestimonials from satisfied customers \nwho say that after using the product, \nthey had amazing hair growth and their \nhair is as thick and strong as it was \nwhen they were teenagers. The \nadvertiser must have competent and \nreliable scientific evidence that its \nproduct is effective in producing new \nhair growth. \n(ii) The web page will also likely \ncommunicate that the endorsers’ \nexperiences are representative of what \nnew users of the product can generally \nexpect. Therefore, even if the advertiser \nincludes a disclaimer such as, ‘‘Notice: \nThese testimonials do not prove our \nproduct works. You should not expect \nto have similar results,’’ the ad is likely \nto be deceptive unless the advertiser has \nadequate substantiation that new users \ntypically will experience results similar \nto those experienced by the \ntestimonialists. \n(2) Example 2. (i) An advertisement \ndisseminated by a company that sells \nheat pumps presents endorsements from \nthree individuals who state that after \ninstalling the company’s heat pump in \ntheir homes, their monthly utility bills \nwent down by $100, $125, and $150, \nrespectively. The ad will likely be \ninterpreted as conveying that such \nsavings are representative of what \nconsumers who buy the heat pump can \ngenerally expect. The advertiser does \nnot have substantiation for that \nrepresentation because, in fact, fewer \nthan 20% of purchasers will save $100 \nor more. A disclosure such as, ‘‘Results \nnot typical’’ or ‘‘These testimonials are \nbased on the experiences of a few \npeople and you are not likely to have \nsimilar results’’ is insufficient to prevent \nthis ad from being deceptive because \nconsumers will still interpret the ad as \nconveying that the specified savings are \nrepresentative of what consumers can \ngenerally expect. \n(A) In another context, the \nCommission tested the communication \nof advertisements containing \ntestimonials that clearly and \nprominently disclosed either ‘‘Results \nnot typical’’ or the stronger ‘‘These \ntestimonials are based on the \nexperiences of a few people and you are \nnot likely to have similar results.’’ \nNeither disclosure adequately reduced \nthe communication that the experiences \ndepicted are generally representative. \nBased upon this research, the \nCommission believes that similar \ndisclaimers regarding the limited \napplicability of an endorser’s experience \nto what consumers may generally expect \nto achieve are unlikely to be effective. \nAlthough the Commission would have \nthe burden of proof in a law \nenforcement action, the Commission \nnotes that an advertiser possessing \nreliable empirical testing demonstrating \nthat the net impression of its \nadvertisement with such a disclaimer is \nnon-deceptive will avoid the risk of the \ninitiation of such an action in the first \ninstance. \n(B) The advertiser should clearly and \nconspicuously disclose the generally \nexpected savings and have adequate \nsubstantiation that homeowners can \nachieve those results. There are multiple \nways that such a disclosure could be \nphrased, e.g., ‘‘the average homeowner \nsaves $35 per month,’’ ‘‘the typical \nfamily saves $50 per month during cold \nmonths and $20 per month in warm \nmonths,’’ or ‘‘most families save 10% on \ntheir utility bills.’’ \n(ii) Disclosures like those in this \nExample 2, specifically paragraph \n(e)(2)(i)(B) of this section, could still be \nmisleading, however, if they only apply \nto limited circumstances that are not \ndescribed in the advertisement. For \nexample, if the advertisement does not \nlimit its claims by geography, it would \nbe misleading if the disclosure of \nexpected results in a nationally \ndisseminated advertisement was based \non the experiences of customers in a \nsouthern climate and the experiences of \nthose customers was much better than \ncould be expected by heat pump users \nin a northern climate. \n(3) Example 3. An advertisement for \na cholesterol-lowering product features \nindividuals who claim that their serum \ncholesterol went down by 120 points \nand 130 points, respectively; the ad \ndoes not mention the endorsers having \nmade any lifestyle changes. A well- \nconducted clinical study shows that the \nproduct reduces the cholesterol levels of \nindividuals with elevated cholesterol by \nan average of 15% and the \nadvertisement clearly and \nconspicuously discloses this fact. \nDespite the presence of this disclosure, \nthe advertisement would be deceptive if \nthe advertiser does not have competent \nand reliable scientific evidence that the \nproduct can produce the specific results \nclaimed by the endorsers (i.e., a 130- \npoint drop in serum cholesterol without \nany lifestyle changes). \n(4) Example 4. (i) An advertisement \nfor a weight-loss product features an \nendorsement by a formerly obese person \nwho says, ‘‘Every day, I drank 2 QRS \nWeight-Loss shakes, ate only raw \nvegetables, and exercised vigorously for \nsix hours at the gym. By the end of six \nmonths, I had gone from 250 pounds to \n140 pounds.’’ The advertisement \naccurately describes the endorser’s \nexperience, and such a result is within \nthe range that would be generally \nexperienced by an extremely overweight \nindividual who consumed QRS Weight- \nLoss shakes, only ate raw vegetables, \nand exercised as the endorser did. \nBecause the endorser clearly describes \nthe limited and truly exceptional \ncircumstances under which they \nachieved the claimed results, the ad is \nnot likely to convey that consumers who \nweigh substantially less or use QRS \nWeight-Loss under less extreme \ncircumstances will lose 110 pounds in \nsix months. If the advertisement simply \nsays that the endorser lost 110 pounds \nin six months using QRS Weight-Loss \ntogether with diet and exercise, \nhowever, this description would not \nadequately alert consumers to the truly \nremarkable circumstances leading to the \nendorser’s weight loss. The advertiser \nmust have substantiation, however, for \nany performance claims conveyed by \nthe endorsement (e.g., that QRS Weight- \nLoss is an effective weight-loss product \nand that the endorser’s weight loss was \nnot caused solely by their dietary \nrestrictions and exercise regimen). \n(ii) If, in the alternative, the \nadvertisement simply features ‘‘before’’ \nand ‘‘after’’ pictures of a woman who \nsays, ‘‘I lost 50 pounds in 6 months with \nQRS Weight-Loss,’’ the ad is likely to \nconvey that the endorser’s experience is \nrepresentative of what consumers will \ngenerally achieve. Therefore, if \nconsumers cannot generally expect to \nachieve such results, the ad would be \ndeceptive. Instead, the ad should clearly \nand conspicuously disclose what they \ncan expect to lose in the depicted \ncircumstances (e.g., ‘‘women who use \nQRS Weight-Loss for six months \ntypically lose 15 pounds’’). A disclosure \nsuch as ‘‘Average weight loss is 1–2 \npounds per week’’ is inadequate \nbecause it does not effectively \ncommunicate the expected weight loss \nover six months. Furthermore, that \ndisclosure likely implies that weight \nloss continues at that rate over six \nmonths, which would not be true if, for \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 17:11 Jul 25, 2023 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00077 Fmt 4700 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\26JYR1.SGM 26JYR1lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with RULES1",

    "page_content": "48108 Federal Register / Vol. 88, No. 142 / Wednesday, July 26, 2023 / Rules and Regulations \nexample, the average weekly weight loss \nover six months is .57 pounds. \n(iii) If the ad features the same \npictures but the testimonialist simply \nsays, ‘‘I lost 50 pounds with QRS \nWeight-Loss,’’ and QRS Weight-Loss \nusers generally do not lose 50 pounds, \nthe ad should disclose what results they \ndo generally achieve (e.g., ‘‘women who \nuse QRS Weight-Loss lose 15 pounds on \naverage’’). A disclosure such as ‘‘most \nwomen who use QRS Weight-Loss lose \nbetween 10 and 50 pounds’’ is \ninadequate because the range specified \nis so broad that it does not sufficiently \ncommunicate what users can generally \nexpect. \n(iv) Assume that a QRS Weight-Loss \nadvertisement contains a disclosure of \ngenerally expected results that is based \nupon the mean weight loss of users. If \nthe mean is substantially affected by \noutliers, then the disclosure would be \nmisleading. For example, if the mean \nweight loss is 15 pounds, but the \nmedian weight loss is 8 pounds, it \nwould be misleading to say that the \naverage weight loss was 15 pounds. In \nsuch cases, the disclosure’s use of \nmedian weight loss instead could help \navoid deception, e.g., ‘‘most users lose \n8 pounds’’ or ‘‘the typical user loses 8 \npounds.’’ \n(v) Assume that QRS Weight-Loss’s \nmanufacturer procured a fake consumer \nreview, reading ‘‘I lost 50 pounds with \nQRS Weight-Loss,’’ and had it published \non a third-party review website. This \nendorsement is deceptive because it was \nnot written by a bona fide user of the \nproduct (see § 255.1(c)) and because it \ndoes not reflect the honest opinions, \nfindings, beliefs, or experience of the \nendorser (see § 255.1(a)). Moreover, the \nmanufacturer would need competent \nand reliable scientific evidence that \nQRS Weight-Loss is capable of causing \n50-pound weight loss. \n(vi) Assume that QRS Weight-Loss is \na diet and exercise program and a \nperson appearing in a QRS Weight-Loss \nad says, ‘‘I lost 50 pounds in 6 months \nwith QRS Weight-Loss.’’ Very few QRS \nWeight-Loss users lose 50 pounds in 6 \nmonths and the ad truthfully discloses, \n‘‘The typical weight loss of QRS Weight- \nLoss users who stick with the program \nfor 6 months is 35 pounds.’’ In fact, only \none-fifth of those who start the QRS \nWeight-Loss program stick with it for 6 \nmonths. The disclosure is inadequate \nbecause it does not communicate what \nthe typical outcome is for users who \nstart the program. In other words, even \nwith the disclosure, the ad does not \ncommunicate what people who join the \nQRS Weight-Loss program can generally \nexpect. \n(vii) Assume that QRS Weight-Loss’s \nmanufacturer forwards reviews for its \nproduct to a third-party review website. \nIf it forwards only favorable reviews or \nomits unfavorable reviews, it is \nengaging in a misleading practice. \n(5) Example 5. An advertisement \npresents the results of a poll of \nconsumers who have used the \nadvertiser’s cake mixes as well as their \nown recipes. The results purport to \nshow that the majority believed that \ntheir families could not tell the \ndifference between the advertised mix \nand their own cakes baked from scratch. \nMany of the consumers are pictured in \nthe advertisement along with relevant, \nquoted portions of their statements \nendorsing the product. This use of the \nresults of a poll or survey of consumers \nrepresents that this is the typical result \nthat ordinary consumers can expect \nfrom the advertiser’s cake mix. \n(6) Example 6. An advertisement \nappears to show a ‘‘hidden camera’’ \nsituation in a crowded cafeteria at \nbreakfast time. A spokesperson for the \nadvertiser asks a series of patrons of the \ncafeteria for their spontaneous, honest \nopinions of the advertiser’s recently \nintroduced breakfast cereal. Even \nthough none of the patrons is \nspecifically identified during the \nadvertisement, the net impression \nconveyed to consumers may well be that \nthese are actual customers. If actors \nhave been employed, this fact should be \nclearly and conspicuously disclosed. \n(7) Example 7. (i) An advertisement \nfor a recently released motion picture \nshows three individuals coming out of \na theater, each of whom gives a positive \nstatement about the movie. These \nindividuals are actual consumers \nexpressing their personal views about \nthe movie. The advertiser does not need \nto have substantiation that their views \nare representative of the opinions that \nmost consumers will have about the \nmovie. Because the consumers’ \nstatements would be understood to be \nthe subjective opinions of only three \npeople, this advertisement is not likely \nto convey a typicality message. \n(ii) If the motion picture studio had \napproached these individuals outside \nthe theater and offered them free tickets \nif they would talk about the movie on \ncamera afterwards or post about it on \nsocial media, that arrangement should \nbe clearly and conspicuously disclosed. \n(See § 255.5.) \n(8) Example 8. (i) A camping goods \nretailer’s website has various product \npages. Each product page provides \nconsumers with the opportunity to \nreview the product and rate it on a five- \nstar scale. Each such page displays the \nproduct’s average star rating and a \nbreakdown of the number of reviews \nwith each star rating, followed by \nindividual consumers’ reviews and \nratings. As such, the website is \nrepresenting that it is providing an \naccurate reflection of the views of the \npurchasers who submitted product \nreviews to the website. If the retailer \nchose to suppress or otherwise not \npublish any reviews with fewer than \nfour stars or reviews that contain \nnegative sentiments, the product pages \nwould be misleading as to purchasers’ \nactual opinions of the products. \n(ii) If the retailer chose not to post \nreviews containing profanity, that \nwould not be unfair or deceptive even \nif reviews containing profanity tend to \nbe negative reviews. However, it would \nbe misleading if the retailer blocked \nnegative reviews containing profanity, \nbut posted positive reviews containing \nprofanity. It would be acceptable for the \nretailer to have a policy against posting \nreviews unrelated to the product at \nissue or related services, for example \nreviews complaining about the owner’s \npolicy positions. But it would be \nmisleading if the retailer chose to filter \nreviews based on other factors that are \nonly a pretext for filtering them based \non negativity. Sellers are not required to \ndisplay customer reviews that contain \nunlawful, harassing, abusive, obscene, \nvulgar, or sexually explicit content; the \npersonal information or likeness of \nanother person; content that is \ninappropriate with respect to race, \ngender, sexuality, or ethnicity; or \nreviews that the seller reasonably \nbelieves are fake, so long as the criteria \nfor withholding reviews are applied \nuniformly to all reviews submitted. \nNeither are sellers required to display \nreviews that are unrelated to their \nproducts or services. A particular \nseller’s customer service, delivery, \nreturns, and exchanges are related to its \nproducts and services. \n(iii) Assume now that each product \npage starts with a glowing five-star \nreview that is labeled as ‘‘the most \nhelpful review.’’ Labeling the review as \nthe most helpful suggests it was voted \nmost helpful by consumers visiting the \nwebsite. If the initial review on each \nsuch page was selected by the retailer \nand was not selected as the most helpful \nreview by other consumers, labeling it \nas the most helpful would be deceptive. \n(9) Example 9. A manufacturer offers \nto pay genuine purchasers $20 each to \nwrite positive reviews of its products on \nthird-party review websites. Such \nreviews are deceptive even if the \npayment is disclosed because their \npositive nature is required by, rather \nthan being merely influenced by, the \npayment.

(See Example 6). \n(10) Example 10. (i) In an attempt to \ncoerce them to delete their reviews, a \nmanufacturer threatens consumers who \npost negative reviews of its products to \nthird-party review websites, with \nphysical threats, with the disclosure of \nembarrassing information, with baseless \nlawsuits (such as actions for defamation \nthat challenge truthful speech or matters \nof opinion), or with lawsuits it actually \ndoes not intend to file. Such threats \namount to an unfair or deceptive \npractice because other consumers would \nlikely be deprived of information \nrelevant to their decision to purchase or \nuse the products, or be misled as to \npurchasers’ actual opinions of the \nproduct.\n2 \n(ii) Assume now that one of the third- \nparty review websites has a reporting \nmechanism that allows businesses to \nflag suspected fake reviews. The \nmanufacturer routinely flags negative \nreviews of its products as fake without \na reasonable basis for believing that they \nactually are fake, resulting in truthful \nreviews being removed from the \nwebsite. This misuse of the reporting \noption is an unfair or deceptive practice. \n(11) Example 11. A marketer contacts \nrecent online, mail-order, and in-store \npurchasers of its products and asks \nthem to provide feedback to the \nmarketer. The marketer then invites \npurchasers who give very positive \nfeedback to post online reviews of the \nproducts on third-party websites. Less \npleased and unhappy purchasers are \nsimply thanked for their feedback. Such \na practice may be an unfair or deceptive \npractice if it results in the posted \nreviews being substantially more \npositive than if the marketer had not \nengaged in the practice. If, in the \nalternative, the marketer had simply \ninvited all recent purchasers to provide \nfeedback on third-party websites, the \nsolicitation would not have been unfair \nor deceptive, even if it had expressed its \nhope for positive reviews. \n§ 255.3 Expert endorsements. \n(a) Whenever an advertisement \nrepresents, expressly or by implication, \nthat the endorser is an expert with \nrespect to the endorsement message, \nthen the endorser’s qualifications must \nin fact give the endorser the expertise \nthat the endorser is represented as \npossessing with respect to the \nendorsement. \n(b) Although an expert may, in \nendorsing a product, take into account \nfactors not within the endorser’s \nexpertise (such as taste or price), the \nendorsement must be supported by an \nactual exercise of the expertise that the \nexpert is represented as possessing in \nevaluating product features or \ncharacteristics which are relevant to an \nordinary consumer’s use of or \nexperience with the product. This \nevaluation must have included an \nexamination or testing of the product at \nleast as extensive as someone with the \nsame degree of represented expertise \nwould normally need to conduct in \norder to support the conclusions \npresented in the endorsement. To the \nextent that the advertisement implies \nthat the endorsement was based upon a \ncomparison to another product or other \nproducts, such comparison must have \nbeen included in the expert’s \nevaluation; and as a result of such \ncomparison, the expert must have \nconcluded that, with respect to those \nfeatures on which the endorser is \nrepresented to be an expert and which \nare relevant and available to an ordinary \nconsumer, the endorsed product is at \nleast equal overall to the competitors’ \nproducts. Moreover, where the net \nimpression created by the endorsement \nis that the advertised product is superior \nto other products with respect to any \nsuch feature or features, then the expert \nmust in fact have found such \nsuperiority. (See § 255.1(e) regarding the \nliability of endorsers.) \n(c) Examples: \n(1) Example 1. An endorsement of a \nparticular automobile by one described \nas an ‘‘engineer’’ implies that the \nendorser’s professional training and \nexperience are such that the endorser is \nwell acquainted with the design and \nperformance of automobiles. If the \nendorser’s field is, for example, \nchemical engineering, the endorsement \nwould be deceptive. \n(2) Example 2. An endorser of a \nhearing aid is simply referred to as a \ndoctor during the course of an \nadvertisement. The ad likely implies \nthat the endorser has expertise in the \narea of hearing, as would be the case if \nthe endorser is a medical doctor with \nsubstantial experience in audiology or a \nnon-medical doctor with a Ph.D. or \nAu.D. in audiology. A doctor without \nsubstantial experience in the area of \nhearing might be able to endorse the \nproduct if the advertisement clearly and \nconspicuously discloses the nature and \nlimits of the endorser’s expertise. \n(3) Example 3. A manufacturer of \nautomobile parts advertises that its \nproducts are approved by the \n‘‘American Institute of Science.’’ From \nits name, consumers would infer that \nthe ‘‘American Institute of Science’’ is a \nbona fide independent testing \norganization with expertise in judging \nautomobile parts and that, as such, it \nwould not approve any automobile part \nwithout first testing its performance by \nmeans of valid scientific methods. If the \nAmerican Institute of Science is not \nsuch a bona fide independent testing \norganization (e.g., if it was established \nand operated by an automotive parts \nmanufacturer), the endorsement would \nbe deceptive. Even if the American \nInstitute of Science is an independent \nbona fide expert testing organization, \nthe endorsement may nevertheless be \ndeceptive unless the Institute has \nconducted valid scientific tests of the \nadvertised products and the test results \nsupport the endorsement message. \n(4) Example 4. A manufacturer of a \nnon-prescription drug product \nrepresents that its product has been \nselected over competing products by a \nlarge metropolitan hospital. The \nhospital has selected the product \nbecause the manufacturer, unlike its \ncompetitors, has packaged each dose of \nthe product separately. This package \nform is not generally available to the \npublic. Under the circumstances, the \nendorsement would be deceptive \nbecause the basis for the hospital’s \nchoice—convenience of packaging—is \nneither relevant nor available to \nconsumers, and the basis for the \nhospital’s decision is not disclosed to \nconsumers. \n(5) Example 5. A person who is \nidentified as the president of a \ncommercial ‘‘home cleaning service’’ \nstates in a television advertisement for \na particular brand of cleanser that the \nservice uses that brand instead of its \nleading competitors because of its \nperformance. Because cleaning services \nextensively use cleansers in the course \nof their business, the ad likely conveys \nthat the president has knowledge \nsuperior to that of ordinary consumers. \nAccordingly, the president’s statement \nwill be deemed to be an expert \nendorsement. The service must, of \ncourse, actually use the endorsed \ncleanser. In addition, because the \nadvertisement implies that the cleaning \nservice has experience with a reasonable \nnumber of leading competitors’ brands \navailable to consumers, the service \nmust, in fact, have such experience, and \nhave determined, based on its expertise, \nthat the endorsed product’s cleaning \nability is at least equal (or superior, if \nsuch is the net impression conveyed by \nVerDate Sep<11>2014 17:11 Jul 25, 2023 Jkt 259001 PO 00000 Frm 00079 Fmt 4700 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\26JYR1.SGM 26JYR1lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with RULES1",

Because in this example the \ncleaning service’s president makes no \nmention that the endorsed cleanser was \n‘‘chosen,’’ ‘‘selected,’’ or otherwise \nevaluated in side-by-side comparisons \nagainst its competitors, it is sufficient if \nthe service has relied solely upon its \naccumulated experience in evaluating \ncleansers without having performed \nside-by-side or scientific comparisons. \n(6) Example 6. A medical doctor \nstates in an advertisement for a drug \nthat the product will safely allow \nconsumers to lower their cholesterol by \n50 points. If the materials the doctor \nreviewed were merely letters from \nsatisfied consumers or the results of a \nrodent study, the endorsement would \nlikely be deceptive because those \nmaterials are not the type of scientific \nevidence that others with the \nrepresented degree of expertise would \nconsider adequate to support this \nconclusion about the product’s safety \nand efficacy. Under such circumstances, \nboth the advertiser and the doctor \nwould be liable for the doctor’s \nmisleading representation. (See \n§ 255.1(d) and (e)) \n§ 255.4 Endorsements by organizations. \n(a) Endorsements by organizations, \nespecially expert ones, are viewed as \nrepresenting the judgment of a group \nwhose collective experience exceeds \nthat of any individual member, and \nwhose judgments are generally free of \nthe sort of subjective factors that vary \nfrom individual to individual. \nTherefore, an organization’s \nendorsement must be reached by a \nprocess sufficient to ensure that the \nendorsement fairly reflects the \ncollective judgment of the organization. \nMoreover, if an organization is \nrepresented as being expert, then, in \nconjunction with a proper exercise of its \nexpertise in evaluating the product \nunder § 255.3, it must utilize an expert \nor experts recognized as such by the \norganization or standards previously \nadopted by the organization and \nsuitable for judging the relevant merits \nof such products. (See § 255.1(e) \nregarding the liability of endorsers.) \n(b) Examples: \n(1) Example 1. A mattress \nmanufacturer advertises that its product \nis endorsed by a chiropractic \nassociation. Because the association \nwould be regarded as expert with \nrespect to judging mattresses, its \nendorsement must be supported by an \nevaluation by an expert or experts \nrecognized as such by the organization, \nor by compliance with standards \npreviously adopted by the organization \nand aimed at measuring the \nperformance of mattresses in general \nand not designed with the unique \nfeatures of the advertised mattress in \nmind. \n(2) Example 2. A trampoline \nmanufacturer sets up and operates what \nappears to be a trampoline review \nwebsite operated by an independent \ntrampoline institute. The site reviews \nthe manufacturer’s trampolines, as well \nas those of competing manufacturers. \nBecause the website falsely appears to \nbe independent, it is deceptive. (See \n§ 255.5.) \n(3) Example 3. (i) A third-party \ncompany operates a wireless headphone \nreview website that provides rankings of \ndifferent manufacturers’ wireless \nheadphones from most recommended to \nleast recommended. The website \noperator accepts money from \nmanufacturers in exchange for higher \nrankings of their products. Regardless of \nwhether the website makes express \nclaims of objectivity or independence, \nsuch paid-for rankings are deceptive \nand the website operator is liable for the \ndeception. A headphone manufacturer \nwho pays for a higher ranking on the \nwebsite may also be held liable for the \ndeception. A disclosure that the website \noperator receives payments from \nheadphone manufacturers would be \ninadequate because the payments \nactually determine the headphones’ \nrelative rankings. If, however, the \nreview website does not take payments \nfor higher rankings, but receives \npayments from some of the headphone \nmanufacturers, such as for affiliate link \nreferrals, it should clearly and \nconspicuously disclose that it receives \nsuch payments. (See § 255.5(k)(11)) \n(ii) Assume that the headphone \nreview website operator uses a ranking \nmethodology that results in higher \nrankings for products whose sellers \nhave a relationship to the operator \nbecause of those relationships. The use \nof such a methodology is also \nmisleading. \n§ 255.5 Disclosure of material \nconnections. \n(a) When there exists a connection \nbetween the endorser and the seller of \nthe advertised product that might \nmaterially affect the weight or \ncredibility of the endorsement, and that \nconnection is not reasonably expected \nby the audience, such connection must \nbe disclosed clearly and conspicuously. \nMaterial connections can include a \nbusiness, family, or personal \nrelationship. They can include \nmonetary payment or the provision of \nfree or discounted products (including \nproducts unrelated to the endorsed \nproduct) to an endorser, regardless of \nwhether the advertiser requires an \nendorsement in return. Material \nconnections can also include other \nbenefits to the endorser, such as early \naccess to a product or the possibility of \nbeing paid, of winning a prize, or of \nappearing on television or in other \nmedia promotions. Some connections \nmay be immaterial because they are too \ninsignificant to affect the weight or \ncredibility given to endorsements. A \nmaterial connection needs to be \ndisclosed when a significant minority of \nthe audience for an endorsement does \nnot understand or expect the \nconnection. A disclosure of a material \nconnection does not require the \ncomplete details of the connection, but \nit must clearly communicate the nature \nof the connection sufficiently for \nconsumers to evaluate its significance. \n(b) Examples: \n(1) Example 1. A drug company \ncommissions research on its product by \nan outside organization. The drug \ncompany determines the overall subject \nof the research (e.g., to test the efficacy \nof a newly developed product) and pays \na substantial share of the expenses of \nthe research project, but the research \norganization determines the protocol for \nthe study and is responsible for \nconducting it. A subsequent \nadvertisement by the drug company \nmentions the research results as the \n‘‘findings’’ of that research organization. \nAlthough the design and conduct of the \nresearch project are controlled by the \noutside research organization, the \nweight consumers place on the reported \nresults could be materially affected by \nknowing that the advertiser had funded \nthe project. Therefore, the advertiser’s \npayment of expenses to the research \norganization should be disclosed in the \nadvertisement. \n(2) Example 2. A film star endorses a \nparticular food product in a television \ncommercial. The endorsement regards \nonly points of taste and individual \npreference. This endorsement must, of \ncourse, comply with § 255.1; but, \nregardless of whether the star’s \ncompensation for the commercial is a $1 \nmillion cash payment or a royalty for \neach product sold by the advertiser \nduring the next year, no disclosure is \nrequired because such payments likely \nare ordinarily expected by viewers. \n(3) Example 3. (i) During an \nappearance by a well-known \nprofessional tennis player on a \ntelevision talk show, the host comments \nthat the past few months have been the \nbest of the player’s career and during \nthis time the player has risen to their \nhighest level ever in the rankings.

The athlete \ndoes not disclose having a contractual \nrelationship with the clinic that \nincludes payment for speaking publicly \nabout the surgery. Consumers might not \nrealize that a celebrity discussing a \nmedical procedure in a television \ninterview has been paid for doing so, \nand knowledge of such payments would \nlikely affect the weight or credibility \nconsumers give to the celebrity’s \nendorsement. Without a clear and \nconspicuous disclosure during the \ninterview that the athlete has been \nengaged as a spokesperson for the clinic, \nthis endorsement is likely to be \ndeceptive. A disclosure during the \nshow’s closing credits would not be \nclear and conspicuous. Furthermore, if \nconsumers are likely to take away from \nthe interview that the athlete’s \nexperience is typical of those who \nundergo the same procedure at the \nclinic, the advertiser must have \nsubstantiation for that claim. \n(ii) Assume that the tennis player \ninstead touts the results of the surgery— \nmentioning the clinic by name—in the \nplayer’s social media post. Consumers \nmight not realize that the athlete is a \npaid endorser, and because that \ninformation might affect the weight \nconsumers give to the tennis player’s \nendorsement, the relationship with the \nclinic should be disclosed—regardless \nof whether the clinic paid the athlete for \nthat particular post. It should be \ndisclosed even if the relationship \ninvolves no payments but only the \ntennis player getting the laser correction \nsurgery for free or at a significantly \nreduced cost. \n(iii)(A) Assume that the clinic reposts \nthe tennis player’s social media post to \nits own social media account and that \nthe player’s original post either— \n(1) Did not have a clear and \nconspicuous disclosure, or \n(2) Had such a disclosure that does \nnot appear clearly and conspicuously in \nthe repost. \n(B) Given the nature of the \nendorsement (i.e., a personally created \nstatement from the tennis player’s social \nmedia account), the viewing audience of \nthe clinic’s social media account would \nlikely reasonably not expect the tennis \nplayer to be compensated. The clinic \nshould clearly and conspicuously \ndisclose its relationship to the athlete in \nits repost. \n(iv) Assume that during the \nappearance on the television talk show, \nthe tennis player is wearing clothes \nbearing the insignia of an athletic wear \ncompany with which the athlete also \nhas an endorsement contract. Although \nthis contract requires wearing the \ncompany’s clothes not only on the court \nbut also in public appearances, when \npossible, the athlete does not mention \nthe clothes or the company during the \nappearance on the show. No disclosure \nis required because no representation is \nbeing made about the clothes in this \ncontext. \n(4) Example 4. (i) A television ad for \nan anti-snoring product features a \nphysician who says, ‘‘I have seen \ndozens of products come on the market \nover the years, and in my opinion, this \nis the best ever.’’ Consumers would \nexpect the physician to be reasonably \ncompensated for appearing in the ad. \nConsumers are unlikely, however, to \nexpect that an expert endorser like the \nphysician receives a percentage of gross \nproduct sales or owns part of the \ncompany, and either of these facts \nwould likely materially affect the \ncredibility that consumers attach to the \nendorsement. Accordingly, the \nadvertisement should clearly and \nconspicuously disclose such a \nconnection between the company and \nthe physician. \n(ii) Assume that the physician is \ninstead paid to post about the product \non social media. In that context, \nconsumers might not expect that the \nphysician was compensated and might \nbe more likely than in a television ad to \nexpect that the physician is expressing \nan independent, professional opinion. \nAccordingly, the post should clearly \nand conspicuously disclose the doctor’s \nconnection with the company. \n(5) Example 5. (i) In a television \nadvertisement, an actual patron of a \nrestaurant, who is neither known to the \npublic nor presented as an expert, is \nshown seated at the counter. The diner \nis asked for a ‘‘spontaneous’’ opinion of \na new food product served in the \nrestaurant. Assume, first, that the \nadvertiser had posted a sign on the door \nof the restaurant informing all who \nentered that day that patrons would be \ninterviewed by the advertiser as part of \nits television promotion of its new \n‘‘meat-alternative’’ burger. A patron \nseeing such a sign might be more \ninclined to give a positive review of that \nitem in order to appear on television. \nThe advertisement should thus clearly \nand conspicuously inform viewers that \nthe patrons on screen knew in advance \nthat they might appear in a television \nadvertisement because that information \nmay materially affect the weight or \ncredibility of the endorsement. \n(ii) Assume, in the alternative, that \nthe advertiser had not posted the sign \nand that patrons asked for their \nopinions about the burger did not know \nor have reason to believe until after their \nresponse that they were being recorded \nfor use in an advertisement. No \ndisclosure is required here, even if \npatrons were also told, after the \ninterview, that they would be paid for \nallowing the use of their opinions in \nadvertising. \n(6) Example 6. (i) An infomercial \nproducer wants to include consumer \nendorsements in an infomercial for an \nautomotive additive product not yet on \nthe market. The producer’s staff selects \nseveral people who work as ‘‘extras’’ in \ncommercials and asks them to use the \nproduct and report back, telling them \nthat they will be paid a small amount \nif selected to endorse the product in the \ninfomercial. Viewers would not expect \nthat these ‘‘consumer endorsers’’ are \nactors who used the product in the hope \nof appearing in the commercial and \nreceiving compensation. Because the \nadvertisement fails to disclose these \nfacts, it is deceptive. \n(ii) Assume that the additive’s \nmarketer wants to have more consumer \nreviews appear on its retail website, \nwhich sells a variety of its automotive \nproducts. The marketer recruits \nordinary consumers to get a free product \n(e.g., a set of jumper cables or a portable \nair compressor for car tires) and a $30 \npayment in exchange for posting a \nconsumer review of the free product on \nthe marketer’s website. The marketer \nmakes clear and the reviewers \nunderstand that they are free to write \nnegative reviews and that there are no \nnegative consequences of doing so. Any \nresulting review that fails to clearly and \nconspicuously disclose the incentives \nprovided to that reviewer is likely \ndeceptive. When the resulting reviews \nmust be positive or reviewers believe \nthey might face negative consequences \nfrom posting negative reviews, a \ndisclosure would be insufficient. (See \n§§ 255.2(d) and (e)(9).) Even if adequate \ndisclosures appear in each incentivized \nreview, the practice could still be \ndeceptive if the solicited reviews \ncontain star ratings that are included in \nan average star rating for the product \nand including the incentivized reviews \nmaterially increases that average star \nrating. If such a material increase \noccurs, the marketer likely would need \nto provide a clear and conspicuous \ndisclosure to people who see the \naverage star rating. \n(7) Example 7.

A tool manufacturer \nsends the influencer an expensive full- \nsize lathe in the hope that the influencer \nwould post about it. The woodworker \nuses the lathe for several products and \ncomments favorably about it in videos. \nIf a significant minority of viewers are \nlikely unaware that the influencer \nreceived the lathe free of charge, the \nwoodworker should clearly and \nconspicuously disclose receiving it for \nfree, a fact that could affect the \ncredibility that viewers attach to the \nendorsements. The manufacturer should \nadvise the woodworker at the time it \nprovides the lathe that this connection \nshould be disclosed, and it should have \nreasonable procedures in place to \nmonitor the influencer’s postings for \ncompliance and follow those \nprocedures. (See § 255.1(d).) \n(8) Example 8. An online community \nhas a section dedicated to discussions of \nrobotic products. Community members \nask and answer questions and otherwise \nexchange information and opinions \nabout robotic products and \ndevelopments. Unbeknownst to this \ncommunity, an employee of a leading \nhome robot manufacturer has been \nposting messages on the discussion \nboard promoting the manufacturer’s \nnew product. Knowledge of this poster’s \nemployment likely would affect the \nweight or credibility of the \nendorsements. Therefore, the poster \nshould clearly and conspicuously \ndisclose their relationship to the \nmanufacturer. To limit its own liability \nfor such posts, the employer should \nengage in appropriate training of \nemployees. To the extent that the \nemployer has directed such \nendorsements or otherwise has reason to \nknow about them, it should also be \nmonitoring them and taking other steps \nto ensure compliance. (See § 255.1(d).) \nThe disclosure requirements in this \nexample would apply equally to \nemployees posting their own reviews of \nthe product on retail websites or review \nplatforms. \n(9) Example 9. A college student signs \nup to be part of a program in which \npoints are awarded each time a \nparticipant posts on social media about \na particular advertiser’s products. \nParticipants can then exchange their \npoints for prizes, such as concert tickets \nor electronics. These incentives would \nmaterially affect the weight or \ncredibility of the college student’s \nendorsements. They should be clearly \nand conspicuously disclosed, and the \nadvertiser should take steps to ensure \nthat these disclosures are being \nprovided. \n(10) Example 10. Great Paper \nCompany sells photocopy paper with \npackaging that has a seal of approval \nfrom the No Chlorine Products \nAssociation, a non-profit third-party \nassociation. Great Paper Company paid \nthe No Chlorine Products Association a \nreasonable fee for the evaluation of its \nproduct and its manufacturing process. \nConsumers would reasonably expect \nthat marketers have to pay for this kind \nof certification. Therefore, there is no \nunexpected material connection \nbetween the company and the \nassociation, and the use of the seal \nwithout disclosure of the fee paid to the \nassociation would not be deceptive. \n(11) Example 11. A coffee lover \ncreates a blog that reviews coffee \nmakers. The blogger writes the content \nindependently of the marketers of the \ncoffee makers but includes affiliate links \nto websites on which consumers can \nbuy these products from their marketers. \nWhenever a consumer clicks on such a \nlink and buys the product, the blogger \nreceives a portion of the sale. Because \nknowledge of this compensation could \naffect the weight or credibility site \nvisitors give to the blogger’s reviews, the \nreviews should clearly and \nconspicuously disclose the \ncompensation. \n(12) Example 12. (i) Near the \nbeginning of a podcast, the host reads \nwhat is obviously a commercial for a \nproduct. Even without a statement \nidentifying the advertiser as a sponsor, \nlisteners would likely still expect that \nthe podcaster was compensated, so \nthere is no need for a disclosure of \npayment for the commercial. Depending \nupon the language of the commercial, \nhowever, the audience may believe that \nthe host is expressing their own views \nin the commercial, in which case the \nhost would need to hold the views \nexpressed. (See § 255.0(b).) \n(ii) Assume that the host also \nmentions the product in a social media \npost. The fact that the host did not have \nto make a disclosure in the podcast has \nno bearing on whether there has to be \na disclosure in the social media post. \n(13) Example 13. An app developer \ngives a consumer a game app to review. \nThe consumer clearly and \nconspicuously discloses in the review \nthat they were given the app, which \nnormally costs 99 cents, for free. That \ndisclosure suggests that the consumer \ndid not receive anything else for the \nreview. If the app developer also gave \nthe consumer $50 for the review, the \nmere disclosure that the app was free \nwould be inadequate. \n(14) Example 14. Speed Ways, an \ninternet Service Provider, advertises \nthat it has the ‘‘Fastest ISP Service’’ as \ndetermined by the ‘‘Data Speed Testing \nCompany.’’ If Speed Ways \ncommissioned and paid for the analysis \nof its and competing services, it should \nclearly and conspicuously disclose its \nrelationship to the testing company \nbecause the relationship would likely be \nmaterial to consumers in evaluating the \nclaim.
